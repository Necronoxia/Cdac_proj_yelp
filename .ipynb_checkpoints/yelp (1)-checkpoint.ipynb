       " 'This review of Vitality is way over due  maybe  I was trying to keep this fantastic place to myself    I am a former dancer and had to stop at the beginning of my career due to injuries  knees and back  that have plagued me ever since  I  basically stopped all physical activity  except for occasionally  joining some random club and going on exercise binges that left me re injured and unable to exercise and the the cycle started all over again  I was able to maintain my low body weight over the years  by basically not eating    Three years ago I had surgery for a torn rotator cuff  great  a new part of my body injured  After a year of PT   the shoulder was stable and I decided it was time to do something about my physical health and do it in a sane way  I really wanted to work with someone who would know how to work with my history of injuries and that I was approaching     I chose Vitality because I saw the owner was both an elite trainer and a physical therapist   The moment I walked into Vitality I felt good about the place  It was beautiful  bright and immaculate  Then I met with Shay  who owns Vitality  she is a positive force  She took the time to really get to know my medical history and asked pertinent questions about who I was and what I was looking for in my training  As soon as we started my first training  I felt confident that I was in the right place  This was an entire new way of working out for me  The personalization and variety of training modalities   attention to form detail and focus on my ability to function in my my daily life without chronic injury was something I had never experienced before  In addition   the encouragement and support of Shay  her staff and other clients made me want to keep going I have been to Vitality starting on three years now and train there up to   times a week   Training at Vitality has been a game changer for me I have never felt better physically and emotionally  stronger and happier with my body image and able to do my work  which is physical as I still work with the ballet at      I am eating so much healthier and look forward to working out  even my physician noticed the  improvement  in my muscle mass and over all condition   Shay carefully choses her other trainers and they are all excellent  Each one has great experience in training at the level I expect at Vitality and brings their own area of expertise  I also love  training with Sofie and Amanda  I highly recommend the group classes and wish I had joined them sooner  They are small  everyone in the class is supportive and the trainer leading the group knows you and modifies any of the exercises to your needs   I have given my athletic  data based executive  and personal training resistant husband  a Christmas gift of health  He could not believe how much Shay accomplished in one session he went back for more and his squash game improved immediately and he could not stop talking about how some chronic pain issues had resolved  I also refer my clients  pre professional ballet students  for functional assessment and training to help manage and prevent injuries that are associated with ballet and have them train in an  out of the ballet box  manner that will improve their ballet training   As you can tell  I fee very positive about this place  If you are looking for for cutting edge  and truly personal training in a supportive and beautiful place  go to Vitality  you will not be disappointed  You are not just another member  you are an individual that they really get to know and care about   Vitality is my happy place   I have',\n",

       " 'I m trying to figure out what happened from the time I started going there in July      to the day in July      I decided that the salon had gone seriously downhill  I think perhaps the popularity of the place has overwhelmed the management and staff    When first started going there  I drank the Kool Aid  The stylists are very knowledgable about black hair and I went to one of the styling workshops  which was very rah rah    I like the hair products when they are actually available  but they seem to have supply problems  For example  I think in the year I went there  I was able to buy the recommended hair glaze once  And even then I pre paid for it and had to wait on a list for it to come in about three weeks later  I ve not seen it stocked since  The same goes for the hair mousse  which it turns out is likely just repackaged Design Essentials brand in a Synergi bottle  I do love the shampoo and conditioner  though   As for the stylists  I m not going to name names because it seems like a general problem  Okay  let s get real  for natural hair  they re really not doing anything high tech  I did see some cute styles walk out of there  but for what I had done  shampoo  trim  twists   nothing special  For that reason  I changed stylists at one point to see someone who was available for my schedule  And guess what  My initial stylist totally BLANKED me when I came in after that  I was  like  seriously  This ain t some NYC salon  But  then  when I came in to buy product  the second stylist blanked me as well  I m willing to go with they just didn t hear me say hello  but whatever    The final straw of me not coming back was  like Rachael  waiting    minutes for an appointment  getting shunted off to a junior stylist because they d overbooked the senior stylist  and it taking me     hours instead of the usual one to get out of there    Okay  I lied  the final final straw was that  and this may have changed  when I first started going there  you could only make an appointment online and only pay with a credit or debit card  TWICE after using my card there  weird unauthorized charges popped up and I had to get new cards  I have no proof that this was Synergi s faulty  but if you check their internet security info in the address bar  the site s not verified nor encrypted meaning sending your credit card info via their site leaves your precious info ass out in the world for fraudsters and identity thieves  The penultimate time I went  I noticed a woman paying cash  so I did the same the last time I bought product    If  after all this advise  you still decide to go  use a prepaid card with the exact amount of your services on it so you don t get jacked ',\n",

service but not here  I just let it go  Also the the lady who runs the place always looks pissed off  Never fails  she is always sitting in the front rolling silverware and waiting for someone to park in the lot  not going to her restaurant  to tow  and yes she will tow  She likes to yell at the people beforehand  It s entertaining  I give   stars because of the food and prices  Don t expect a lot here  it s very simple  just good food cheap ',\n 'Get the fish tacos    for   and the    margaritas are good  aka not filled with ice and or watered down  ',\n 'This was a great experience the employee were very humorous and took excellent care of the animals  The park also offered many different viewings of the animals  You don t really think it s going to be as big as it is until you get there  so definitely go early because there s many things I wish I could ve done but got there late ',\n 'I ve been wearing glasses since I was   years old and in all of my years I ve never had such a thorough eye exam  The staff was wonderful  The lady with bright red hair helped me pick out the perfect pair of glasses  she had fabulous style and was truly one of a kind  I will be back for sure ',\n 'Jasmine did my hair and although she is sweet as pie  she did not do a good job on my hair at all  My roots are not straightened  the flat iron she used looked old and like it came from Walmart  My hair is dry and there is no body in it at all  I tipped her because she took me close to closing  All in all  I wouldn t return  People who gave African American hair should not go here ',\n 'Loved it  We went last night for my husband s birthday and everyone was happy with their choices  It s smaller inside than I expected     tables and a bar  Most of the tables are outside  Everyone got something different  stuffed grouper  ahi  salmon  scallops  grouper sandwich  and a burger  We all shared some bites and everything was good and seemed fresh  Everything was cooked well and delicious  Service was good and the beer was cheap  My only complaint is we were too full for dessert and  seeing some pass by  they looked amazing ',\n 'We called S S based on recommendations on Yelp  They came promptly for an estimate  and came about ten days later to install the door  They showed up when they said they would and completed the work in about       hours  They installed the door and opener and even programmed our cars for the opener  The men were were pleasant and helpful  and we thought the price was reasonable  Would highly recommend them ',\n 'Got the  papusas  for six fifty  but it only came with one medium sized papusa and some kind of vinegar slaw  Had better papusas in the past  Overall underwhelmed  Try something else hereor pass it up ',\n 'Love this place  Food is excellent  chef is excellent  Great music throughout the week and hands down best place to watch Sunday Football  Staff is also great  Bartenders are amazing and never mess up an order  Try the Fried chicken and tots as my favs ',\n 'Love this place   Been three times now   I ve tried all the pizzas and they are delicious   I love the Heat   Also the unicorn wings are super good  This is a new regular place for me  I need to try the sandwich next ',\n 'The food here is authentic and several of the dishes are amazing that we keep coming back almost weekly to eat all our of our favorites   This week  I am bringing my family back too ',\n 'The night we spent here was one of the worst nights of my life  The bed was like sleeping on a board  The heating system was beyond pathetic  The noise level from across the street was unbearable  Never again  green or not ',\n 'We had Magic Bites cater a party for     The process couldn t have been easier and the food couldn t have been more delicious  I m already eating at Magic Bites     times a week as it is  They feed me regularly  Having them cater a gathering was a no brainer  Highly recommended   ',\n 'Favorite restaurant of all time  High quality food  High quality atmosphere  High quality service  In addition  Persian food is amazing  especially when done right like how they do it at Rumi s ',\n 'Best Fondue and Seasonal Accompaniments  Overall  B        Service      I m always satisfied with the geniality of the waiter or waitress  but a few times I ve had to wait uncomfortably long for my food to arrive  If you aren

one time And when you ask for onions this is what you get ',\n 'One of my favorite spots to get a margherita pizzas for    and house wine for     between   am    pm   The new place is chinar to their original location as it is counter service  The interior is spacious and they also have a some tables for outdoor dining    The pizza comes out quick from their wood fired oven  I normally don t eat crusts  but for this place I will  The flavors are great and the thin crust makes it so easy to eat a lot  Another pizza that s great there is the sausage with mama s peppers  You can t go wrong with it   Overall  great place with superb service ',\n 'Love these ULTA shops   Have been to both the one in Plymouth and the one in Braintree   Nice set up  Clean and organized and can find lots of beauty products I usually have a hard time finding    I noticed that they also have a salon in the back so gave the a try   I was set up with Beti  very personable and loved my cut   I have short hair so Im particular with my cuts   She styled it exactly the way I like   I think I may have found my hairstylist ',\n 'I absolutely love Lala s  I think its hands down my favorite bar in Austin  the old school Christmas decor totally makes it  it is void of all things hipster and trendy and I think that is why I like it so much  its like drinking at your grandparents house  Try the HAMBURGERS  you wouldn t think it but they are probably the best in town and only     I try to avoid Lala s on the weekends as its so incredibly packed out  but Tuesday through Thursday are GREAT days to go  closed Monday   AWESOME JUKEBOX  The only thing I don t like is they allow smoking so sometimes it gets a little intense and overwhelming since its a small bar but overall its a magical place ',\n 'Went there tonight to view the Bruins game  eat  and drink some beers   We had a party of     First of all  they would not take a waiting list  the servers just picked and chose who they wanted at their table    terrible way of operating a restaurant   THEN the waitress lied about not being able to sell us pitchers of beer and or tall beers  meanwhile EVERY TABLE AROUND US HAD THEM    Not very smart to lie because the buckets of beer are more expensive  I wasn t born yesterday   The waitress CONTINUOUSLY exclaimed she was following MANAGEMENTS orders but miraculously as soon as I requested to speak with a manager  pitchers of beer were available   The service was absolutely terrible  everyone at our table ended up purchasing beers from the bar or the beer girl at the entrance to the lounge    Honestly  the only good thing I have to say about this place is that the BEER GIRL at the entrance to the lounge was quite pleasant and personable   She was constantly smiling and working for that money   I would have traded our waitress for this girl in a heart beat    The one star is for the Beer Girl  and for her only     That is all ',\n 'Okay this place is amazing  I have had persian food from many places  and this place is in the top    The chicken and beef koobideh are out of this world   Extremely tasty and juicy  and the rice and tomato pairing take it to another level  The customer service is top notch  and I was really impressed with the bread  Definitely a must try ',\n 'Yea I don t know how they stay in business I was there about two months ago had the dots the only thing I tasted was sugar for about   oz maybe of dots and it was nothing to talk about will never go back to eat something like that again',\n 'Thankfully this was one of the few places on the hot chocolate festival list that was open late for the common working folks like myself  The advantage of winter is that no one is lining up half a block down for gelato  therefore  it was an easy in and out operation The establishment is clean yet has a busy decor feel  The lady at the til was super friendly  sweet and had a genuine smile on her face  I had the Salted Pecan   Maple Syrup  the gold medal winner from the      Gelato Competition in Italy  served with Erin Ireland s  To Die For  Banana Bread Holy shit I was in heaven at first bite  or rather sip   I m immediately hit with the salty taste with a sweet aftertaste  It was an awesome sweet savory oral sensation in my mouth  It was the most addicting hot chocolate to drink in one go  It was nice to taste a smooth hot chocolate that didn t try to compete for dominance in terms of flavor notes It s best to get this without whip cream so that you can taste the true art of the drink as intended  The banana bread was extremely greasy  My fingers shouldn t be glistening like a male Vegas stripper after eating a pastry  Total cost      ',\n 'What a wonderful company  Tom was great initially with getting me a quote and calling me back in a prompt manner    We rented their brand new   person stretch and a    person shuttle bus for our wedding this past weekend  The   person stretch was beautiful and clean  same with the shuttle bus  The drivers were very nice and were very accomodating  They arrived on time if not before  and we had no issues    I probably won t be working with any other limo company  Good job guys  thanks so much  ',\n 'I am Peruvian  born and raised  Since moving to the US  I have had difficulty finding quality Peruvian food that reminds me of home    Llama s is the first place that has given me authentic tasting Peruvian food that keeps me coming back for more  Living in Houston  I have tried the likes of the Lemon Tree  Pollo Bravo  Latin Bites and other restaurants that pop up from time to time and disappear within the year  Nothing compares to the genuine  homecooked taste from Llama s food truck  I had to travel to Austin to find it  but I will keep coming back just for this food   The combination of flavors is intricately and expertly put together  If you are a noob to Peruvian food  I highly recommend starting with the    Pork Sandwich  It is the juiciest  tenderest pork I ve had and considering I hate pork on every other occasion  it s amazing that this sandwich is enough to turn my taste buds  My next two favorites are    and     You cannot go wrong with any of these   The employees are always kind and pleasant  and I have yet to try anything on the menu that I didn t like   I have seen complaints about not getting good portions for what you pay  but I always leave full and beyond satisfied  This is a gem and you should not visit Austin without stopping here at least once ',\n '  oz beers  Super fast service with tons of counters  Wicked crowded  not a place to have a deep conversation  but a great spot to grab some food before the game ',\n 'Came here because of good reviews and ravings from locals  Plus  I was so craving some awesome fried chicken  Hmmm    Where do I begin  Now i consider myself an expert on fried chicken  and this place did not make me dance  The chicken was bland and didnt have the golden color of awesome southern fried chicken that I have missed so much  I mean who really loves light sickly brown chicken wings  On top of that   The wings look like they came from some midget chickens  We literally had to douse these wings with a whole bottle of Red Rooster just to get it down     And then we ordered chicken and dumplings   I dont know what can those came from  but they were nasty    Our dessert hasnt come in yet  but based on the spread we just had     Can we say diarrhea  lord help us all      I dont know what the hell kind of people like this kind of food ',\n 'Shopped here a few times  for different things   Great advice  other shops also referred me here because they didn t have what I needed   Excited to find some local products   apparently people in CO like to sleep because so much matress and related stuff is made here in Colorado   I ve talked to two employees here  father   son    both were knowledgeable about their products and the concept of sleep    They seemed much more interested in making sure that you get something you re happy with than I found at other similar shops  not that any of the other places I visited were really bad    On top of having good products and service  they have a good location and hours   No experience with delivery  as I picked up all my stuff   Bottom line   I felt their shop was top notch and am much more happy to give them my     than to the Mattress Czar super chain   BTW  I just searched and there seem to be four shops in CO and one in Texas   Check it out  you can always leave if you are sticker shocked ',\n 'Only our server  Luke  brought this dinning experience up to a three star  My brisket tacos were tough and flavorless  My house margarita was sour and just plain terrible      We were a party of    and our server was super   Others enjoyed their meals so maybe I just picked the wrong food and drink ',\n 'As far as a DEQ goes  this one is not too bad  In and out real quick  I d give it   stars  but coming here always means forking out money I don t want to ',\n 'Unprofessional staff here  They will tell you anything to get you to buy a phone  I felt like I was lied to about how long I had to return a product and was treated unfairly when attempting to do so ',\n 'We were hungry after spending a few hours at Costco  Hotdogs and pizzas were not on our palate  So we used Yelp to find the nearest restaurant around the area  We decided on thai food  We were lost at first  It was difficult to find the place  It was just a  hole in a wall  in a not so enticing shopping plaza by Costco on Sandy Blvd   We didn t know what to order  So we stuck with what we know  pad thai noodles  curry  etc   Since there was just the two of us  we ordered a plate of drunken noodles and red curry  Both with beef  Of course  we also got Thai iced tea    The red curry came out smelling really good  As our mouth were salivating  the rice came in a heart shape  which was to my niece s delight  and the drunken noodles were a bit too sweet for our taste but it was still good nevertheless  The portion was pretty generous  We ended up packing up the rest of our food for a late dinner   My niece really loved the thoughtfulness in the heart shaped rice and this little gesture definitely gets us coming back for more in the future    We also noticed the extensive lunch menu  All for    on chicken   beef     for seafood  Hopefully the next Costco expedition ends at noon ',\n 'Best  Place  Ever   I eat here breakfast  lunch and dinner if possible  Easy walk from Beacon Hill  Staff is accommodating   Cheese selection is superb  Only downside  no wine   ',\n 'My husband  son  and I came in one evening and got food to go  Unfortunately most of it was inedible  The hummus was very gritty in texture and sooooo salty  The falafel were soggy  cold  and soaked in grease  They don t make their own pita bread or baklava  The rice was very under cooked and too hard to eat  The salad was limp and swimming in oil  My husband did  however  enjoy the kabob  It was quite over cooked and dry though  Something similar to jerky  but had good flavor    Inside  the restaurant was a mess  oddly sticky floors  dishes piled up  etc  Overall we were quite unimpressed and can t figure out why the high ratings are so prolific  Perhaps we came at an off time  No idea  But we will continue giving our business to Arpeggio Grill whose food is consistent and of far better quality ',\n 'I think the food here is great   I have eaten there at least    times  and I have never had a bad experience   The food is not Indian  there are similarities  but to me it is more refined   I taste all kinds of individual spices and flavors that are all muddled together in the Indian food I have eaten   Just my opinion of course  maybe I just haven t had that good of Indian food  although I do like Indian food ',\n 'They don t care about their customers   Here s what I posted on their faceb  I ordered   bracelets on       before you changed your processing time from     days to        When I finally got through after calling over    times in one day  seriously  a busy signal in        I asked to have the shipping expedited because I had to ship my order to my family along with our other gifts we had for them   We were told you only ship UPS Ground and make no exceptions   Yet I saw in your responses to Better Business Bureau complaints  the only way to get an actual response from someone  the closer it got to Christmas you switched to   day and then overnight   Why couldn t you make that exception for me when I explained my situation   You also wouldn t change the shipping address so we could send them directly to family   This was still   days before you actually shipped them to me   For all your talk about positivity you sure leave a lot of customers feeling negative and bitter ',\n 'Terrible experience with ZTrip Yellow cab  I used the app to make a reservation the night before for a cab to the Boulder Transit Center to catch an airport bus  In the morning I got a notification  your driver is enroute  Fifteen minutes after the cab should have arrived I called Yellow Cab  The dispatcher said  no drivers have picked up your reservation   WTF  So it s up to the drivers to decide if they feel like honoring my reservation  Missed my bus to the airport  Got a text    minutes later   Hey  we apologize  but your driver had to cancel  Please try booking another trip   Never Again   ',\n 'Found this place on Yelp   I m always looking for a great little breakfast place that s close to home  The service was super friendly and the decor is cute  The food itself was pretty good   I wouldn t rave about it per se  but all of us had solid meals  Portions were generous  none of us left hungry  The bill for five of us to eat breakfast  close to      felt a little steep considering you order at the counter and it s basically good diner food  Overall I d return here  but I wouldn t rush back ',\n 'So after living in Florida for    months  I finally convinced my family of vegetarians to give it a try  Let s start with     The Good      Decent tasting food     Comes out very quick  although there were only   groups of diners in the restaurant at the time      Everything is covered in vegetables  And I do mean COVERED     Great tasting curry   The Bad      The service is horrible   The server literally discouraged us from     of the menu   Whenever I selected an item  she would say  it has a lot of celery  Only get if you like celery   I asked her if the cook could leave out a lot of the celery and she would say no  because celery is the main component of the dish   that was     of the dishes on the menu   I then asked about the gluten and she said  don t get that   it s too hard to chew    I kid you not      There is no flexibility in the menu preparations at all  see above       The dining area needed to be cleaned   the tables and chairs were sticky and very unclean looking   The Ugly      The bathrooms   do yourself a favor and go before you leave home   It smells awful and looks worse than that   Which makes me very concerned about the safety of the food which I consumed      Not the greatest part of town  but certainly not the worst either   The bars around the ENTIRE building doesn t provide a sense of security at all  and you re probably better off ordering your food to go  which I saw a lot of folks do    All in all  there are other vegetarian restaurants in the area  and I think Garden Cafe needs to up their game before they are pushed out of the game ',\n 'Ohhhh wow how do I even start     EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE     Mom and son   star gem  Everything was super fresh and beyond delish  We have been to several seafood boil places in Orlando and none can compare and I mean NONE    Drive from Orlando is sooooooooooooooo worth it  Trust me you won t regret it you will actually thank them      My daughter even gave it   thumbs up     I m not one to give reviews but they actually deserve for everyone to know about them     Sooooooo GOOD   ',\n 'Columbus doesn t have a ton of choices for Korean food  and this is a pretty good one   The location is fairly convenient in a strip mall off Bethel Road  and there is a huge parking lot   The exterior is nothing too special  inside they have one small main dining room with tables and chairs   Through a doorway is another similarly sized dining room which looks a bit more updated in terms of decor and overall feel   The service has always been friendly with a Korean flair   They re not going to be effervescently friendly and constantly asking if everything is OK  but they are going to be efficient and appreciative of you as a customer   You may need to flag them down if you want a refill of something   They have a large menu with both common and more rare Korean dishes   We had a large group on this recent visit and tried a ton of different things   The friend dumplings are a good appetizer choice  Crispy and plump  and you get quite a few of them  I think    for the price           The LA style Kalbi was definitely the highlight   Tender  flavorful  and served on a sizzling skillet   At        it is not cheap but is definitely worth it   The beef and pork bulgogi were also very good  the pork is bit spicy but very manageable   Both were extremely tender  simple  and tasty     The banchan  side dishes  were varied and tasty as well  the kimchi was the highlight here   and you can have more of any of them at no extra charge     Overall  this is a great place to come and try some authentic Korean food in Columbus ',\n 'We had a last minute request for a bounce house same day and the guy Who helped me over the phone was able to book us a bounce house

cupcake EVA   It looked like a hostess cupcake   but oh so much better   Velvety Chocolate  with buttery chocolate frosting   creamy white filling placed oh so perfectly in the center    lulu s  written on the top in white frosting   sure a little knock off from Hostess but that s where it ends   Lulu s so takes Hostess     From my first bite into it s velvety goodness   man it was so moist   to licking the chocolate and filling  off my fingers      Darn    I said outloud to myself   Thankfully I didn t answer   I should have eaten one in the club last night when Ligaya being her cute self was pushing these like a dealer    Hmmm  it s only  am  I wonder if Lulu is still chillin at the bakery    Should I get in my car and drive past just incase   OK get a grip  dont  be silly    Jeez   Girl stop talking to yourself    So I went to bed instead with a happy tummy but craving more   Now mind you I haven t stepped foot in the place   but do I need to   Ofcourse   I need to give this a fair rating  not to mentnion find out if the owner was having a bad day with Ligaya  or if she truely is a little Brusque   But for now   go in and at least check the cupcakes because those alone are worth   stars   That is all   Cupcake Speed ',\n 'Just a few steps from my door it s one of my favorite places to go   Being a gluten free eater  I love their menu as it caters to me  their staff time

 They forgot my extra side and gave it to me an hour later when there was no point as I had finished my main dish  More staff and better logistics is needed ',\n 'When I need to lose myself in the glory of a true IMAX experience  complete with Tempur Pedic seats that have subwoofers underneath  em   I head to the IMAX at Jordan s in Reading  It s sort of hidden in the store  and you have to walk through the furniture to get to it  but that s also kind of fun  The screen in massive  and they re still using authentic IMAX film projectors  The tickets here are cheaper than at the LieMAX in Hooksett  and the experience is guaranteed to be better   Unfortunately they don t show all the newest IMAX releases here  I had to settle for The Avengers on a smaller screen  because for some idiotic reason they were holding out in order to show Dark Shadows on this screen  Still  this is easily the best screen within driving distance of me  Concord NH  and it s always been worth the trip

get seated  but after the first bite of the Raman I finally realize what the wait was all about  No question the best Raman I had in Boston so far  another level beyond Santouku  Because of the wait I took off one star but the food is   star  will come back if the wait is reduced  people mention weekday the wait is half  will give it a try on the weekday',\n 'Nationwide Discount Mufflers and Brakes do excellent work other than mufflers and brakes   I highly recommend this business   They are highly trained and competent mechanics  honest  reliable  and very nice people to deal with   They did a superb job repairing a noise in my front wheel ',\n 'I eat at the Stuart Street location almost every day and it is easily the best lunch deal in the Back Bay   Their pizza is great  It s about    a slice but it s a HUGE slice and has plenty of toppings   It s tough to get it really hot unless you get a whole pie but that s life  Excellent salads  cold sandwiches  hot sandwiches and pasta  There s a reason the line goes out the door  The prices are super reasonable  I only wish they had a location in Watertown where I live ',\n 'Pretty good for an airport location  Decent IPA  excellent pork wrap  good kale with chicken  extra  salad  Sadly the kitchen took a bit too long and we had to repackage to go or miss boarding  Are the salad two days later  and it was better than the bite when fresh ',\n 'Great drink menu and dinner options  A good variety of cocktails  wine  and beer  The time we visited for brunch was a little disappointing  We realized after the fact that every single one of our meals was missing something   my omelet was missing cheese  my friend s meal was missing the beans  etc  Still good but missing the ingredients that would have made the meal complete  However  service has always been outstanding   servers are friendly and accommodating  Love it ',\n 'This place is one of my favourite places for Chinese food    Ken s Chinese Restaurant has a big enough parking lot for you to find parking easily  and if there is no parking there you have lots of street parking to choose from  The place is very clean  spacious and easy to get around  Service is great  Usually it is Jimmy or Ken  and they are both very nice and professional people  Late night food  western menu  crab  fish or anything else on the menu  everything is delicious  I would recommend the speciality crab  something you will want to try     Also  if you are feeling lazy they do deliver as well  and accept credit cards   I know that Ken s Chinese Restaurant has been around for awhile now  with lots of happy customers therefore you know they are doing something right ',\n 'The USA womens soccer match was done in the first   minutes but the party kept going until the end

before  Fortunately  it worked out great  I called the day of for a reservation thinking I was going to get turned away and it wasn t a problem  It was also regular price and not some jacked up New Year s Eve ripoff like a lot of restaurants  The entrees are mostly under     and good portions   When we arrived  our table was ready and we were promptly seated although they weren t maxed out  so we could have walked in and got a seat  The decor is simple and tasteful  and they have nice lighting    We started with a sampler platter that had a mix of appetizers  I m not a huge Indian appetizer fan to begin with  but I tried a few of the items  I would categorize it as a mixed bag  some good  some not so good  It was a lot of food and there was still a good amount left even after four of us had noshed  Next time I would skip the appetizer and save my appetite for more of the entree and naan   I was spoiled for choice with the variety of menu items which is usually not the case for a picky person like me  I got the chicken curry and asked for it to be very spicy  It was very spicy  but not so spicy that I couldn t enjoy it  Everything about it was delicious  the flavor and the texture of the sauce  the tenderness of the chicken  and it didn t have any  funky bits  in it    Being a proper Yelper  I had to try my friends  dishes so I could give a proper report  The shrimp korma and the chicken masala were both were super  In addition  the garlic naan was great as well as the chutney and sauces that we devoured and had to get refilled   The service was pretty good  but I wouldn t call it exceptional  Our server wasn t quite as attentive as he could have been  but my sense was that he lacked some experience more than anything else  My friend had asked about the ingredients of one of the appetizers to make sure there wasn t anything he was allergic to and the waiter said he would check  He never did  and we had to ask him again  He also didn t quite get that when there is an empty plate at a table  you should take it to make room for the next plate  However  he did get all of our orders right and the packed up our take homes correctly   We were the last people to leave and although they were starting their prep for the next day  I didn t feel like they were pushing us out the door after we just spent a good bit of cash    I will be making this one of my neighborhood haunts when I m looking for some spice and rice ',\n 'It is without hesitation that I recommend Grill      Bar of Boston  MA   The service is top notch and the food is fantastic   There are other steak restaurants in Boston but only one I would assign Yelp s highest rating   Make a reservation and get to the restaurant early enough to enjoy the atmosphere of the bar and some house potato chips ',\n 'We were so pleased with every aspect of our stay  The beds are very comfortable and the design of the room overall is comfortable and seems very thought out  The staff was also very friendly  I would stay here again without hesitation and will recommend it to everyone ',\n 'oKAY   so normally   star restaurants are well  actually restaurants  however  this place is truly amazing   The ambience   the charm  the location  the art    wow   I had heard good things about the food but am always ALWAYS  a skeptic   I was advised by a friend to go early and be prepared to be relaxed   I took her advice and did just that    This place gets incredibly busy   If you do go early  you will have a better chance at better service faster   They start service at  pm and go pretty late   until midnight some nights and  am other nights  We didn t arrive until     and still got decent service   We were never ignored    I ordered several dishes with friends and we sampled them all     CHICKEN KORMA    AMAZING  LAMB TIKKA   SUPERB VEGETABLE SAAG    PERFECTLY CARMELIZED  TANDOORI BAKED NAAN BREAD    PERFECT  HOT  DELICIOUS  they even have vegan options   so good for those of you who have that particular need cuisine lifestyle  something for everyone   and BYOB  totally worth the trip   We didn t mind the price when it was said and done because excellent food should cost a bit more   I did not care much for the paper plates and bowls but this IS a food trailer folks   And it really did feel like a charming pocket of  a third world country     The mango lassi was delicious and the chai tea was very authentic  GO  GO   closed Mondays    excellence needs a day off ',\n 'Food s ok  I recommend Bamboo in Burlington instead of this place ',\n 'Great Drinks better food  I had multi foodgasms here  You Will Too ',\n 'My husband and I come to the restaurant frequently  It never disappoints  The goat cheese french toast is out of this world  The steak frites is also amazing  Make a reservation and grab drinks at the bar  If it s near Christmas time  request a seat by the window to see the lights at the botanical gardens ',\n 'Food was fine  solid  Service started out great but then as they got busy we lost our server who was apparently taking tables all over the restaurant and outside  They need to designate sections for the servers and maybe get a bartender  ',\n 'The issue I had was cutting it off the bone  It was served in a bowl and was it hard to cut through the silver skin    Once I freed the mea  I found it was tasty ',\n 'Margarita pizza was great  Crispy crust and great flavor  Skip the fountain drink  super small and only a few sips after you put ice in it  or I guess you could drink warm soda   Definitely stop by if you re in the area ',\n 'The freshest ingredients always and the best flavor  They get an A    for consistency  Only fault I can see is from time to time depending on the day and time of day  the wait can be pretty long  No complaints otherwise ',\n 'I love this place  The sushi is top notch and pretty speedy  This is our    pick in Gresham ',\n 'Just picked up my car from their collision center and I was extremely pleased with the repairs done  The crew there were great about explaining the repair process to me and they kept me updated  As a woman coming into an automotive place for repairs it was very reassuring to have people who were willing to take the time to talk to me and not be condescending ',\n 'I stayed here on a recent business trip to Orlando and found this hotel to be a good value at     a night  Nicely appointed rooms  good health club  large pools jacuzzis  and lively pool bar  Wi Fi was a bit much at      but overall it was a good stay    Another plus was that you couldn t hear or  see the traffic and had no idea that the hotel was located on the busy intersection of International drive and Sand Lake Blvd   A very nice benefit if you like seclusion ',\n 'It s the Arby s food I remember from decades past  and was as good as always   However  this location is in a sketchy area rife with beggars and homeless folk  Shouldn t have been too much of a surprise that customers were getting accosted inside the restaurant by a young guy peddling cologne  The part that surprised me was that management and staff didn t care to do anything about it ',\n 'The Good       it s a local business       they have stuff for both dogs and cats       service is SUPER friendly and helpful      store is big  clean  and has a great layout  stuff is really easy to find       lots of awesome high end  quality brands of foods  both dog and cat  dry fresh raw canned  etc   treats  accessories  and more      they are the only store to carry certain brands like Nulo and Lotus      they have dog cookies       bulk dog treats       bulk dog chews like bones and more      they have wash stations in closed rooms so that it s less traumatizing for your pet  for     you can wash your dog with a variety of shampoos  and there s towels  smocks  dryers  ear cleaner  and more to use  all included       great return policy  satisfaction guaranteed  i ve had to use this already for supplements my dog refused to take  otherwise i would have been stuck with     in supplements       lots of parking   The Bad       none  The Ugly       none  Would I go back        yes  Can t wait to bring my little pooch here to let him sniff things to his heart s delight ',\n 'Not a big fan of the pizza      but the set up is cute and rustic chic  Very inexpensive  thankfully considering I wasn t pleased with my Hawaiian pizza   Maybe I should ve ordered pepperoni or something   ',\n 'I must try more of the burgers  The spam made my burger too salty and thus not as enjoyable  Everything else was delicious though  The fried egg was a perfect addition to my honker of a cheeseburger ',\n 'Walked into this store because I needed shoes for work   I m not sure if it s always been this high end   but every shoe they were selling was      plus tax ',\n 'Good cafe Americana and free wifi  They were roasting beans which was cool  but extremely loud  Had to step outside to take a phone call  I d probably go somewhere else to get work done ',\n 'I want to love this place but I didn t  Serves here is great but the food wasn t  The portion of the food here is really big which was great  I m not going to lie but I wished I love this place like most people rave about  Foods look really good but the only problem is the tasted and the quilty of the seafood here isn t so great  I had better Louisiana food at other places than here    The corn chowder was ok but it didn t hit the spots  I had the Grouper Orleans and it was about     and this dish was so bad that I couldn t even eat it  The fish has a spoiled fish tasted like the fish has gone bad  The crawfish tail was ok but I had better crawfish tails before  The crab meats in the sauce were so bad  I know what a fresh crab meat tasted like and this wasn t  The crab meat has gone bad and it tasted nasty  I had to send my dish back and the waiter was nice enough to take that out my order    My friends had the Crawfish Combo     and her dish wasn t that great either  She was so hungry so she tries to eat some of the crawfish tail  They used the same crab meats and she couldn t even eat it ',\n 'This pizza is so very delicious  and they deliver  What else do you need to know ',\n 'What I had thought would ve been a      repair quoted by a competitor  The staff at Bradshaw s presented an option that fixed the problem that was      less  Not only because the unfortunate situation turned fortunate  I really really appreciated the transparency and communication Steve provided me alongside the timely service  Lifetime customer won here ',\n 'The first question that came to mind    what s the big deal    Then I think  maybe  I figured it out   If you are comparing this to a fast food place   it s   stars   If you are expecting a gourmet burger joint   then well  not so much   The prices and portions are what you d expect from a fast food place  but at a higher quality   The burgers are on the small side and not very flavorful   but did the trick    Service was fast and friendly and the picnic tables are a nice way to make up for the lack of a dining room   Would I go back   Sure   And next time I ll know what to expect ',\n 'This place is pretty crowded at lunch time  ie expect a wait   The service is ok  but unspectacular  The seating situation is limited and while busy downright difficult   I have abided much worse in terms of set up and service for good pizza though  Unfortunately  I do not consider this good pizza  I had   slices  one with just pepperoni  one with pepperoni and garlic  and one with hot sausage and garlic  The pizza was thin  which I like   but was a little soggy for my tastes  The garlic was unevenly heaped on the slices so some bites were like eating a spoonful of chopped garlic   I couldn t find a seat inside so I had to eat outside a block away  I did get to enjoy a homeless guy having a rather spirited conversation with himself though   One thing  I saw the sausage rolls and they looked really good  I will probably make a return trip just to try them out ',\n 'Located in one of the most touristy areas of Vancouver   Granville Island  it sure has a prime time spot for suckers  This is not a place that locals go unless someone from out of town suggest s it  It definitely wins all sorts of points for location but it really could do some much better if it pushed there menu a bit  Prices are really high for what they offer  Pizza s for      Ok they are nice  thinly sliced pizza s  but still  It s high  You can share it with someone as a light meal or appetizer  Drink prices ran around    which isn t bad but they sure could use some specials  Oh wait i forgot  you don t need specials when you have the best location on Granville Island  They do have a midweek happy hour on appetizers from    pm but the prices basically seemed normal at half price  Service was good none the less ',\n 'It seems ridiculous to review a fast food place  mainly because they re almost all exactly the same and that I do not frequent them  at least when sober   However  when it s super late at night and there s nothing else open but Jack s  I get the hankering for a few of their tacos  still two for a dollar    Note that it s been probably at least three years since I ve been to a Jack in the Box  and boy has it gone downhill over the years    I pull into the drive thru  order a bacon cheeseburger  chicken sandwich  four tacos and some fries  I get home   no fries  Well darn  now I don t want to waste a dollar in gas to drive back and get my dollar fries  I open up the burger  It seems to be the size of a silver dollar  with two measly bacon strips  some ketchup and the pathetic patty  It s almost insultingly bad to the burger gods  but oh well  It s super dry and disgusting       Next    Chicken sandwich tastes fresher and the breast meat is semi moist  but again it s much smaller than I remember them being  It s passable       Tacos are absolutely disgusting  They re just a greasy  disgusting mess and the taco equivalent to a White Castle burger back east  I can t believe I used to eat this crap when I was younger         Almost every time I go here  the place is nearly empty and understandably so  It is a good reminder why I don t eat fast food anymore  along with it s rapid descent into mediocrity ',\n 'Kinda funny when you walk in to a Spa during business hours only to be told they have no Spa Attendants today   Properly staffed business go a lot farther then those with no staff',\n 'Pacini s is a very casual place serving Classic Italian   modern dishes  as well as  pizza  calzones    paninis  delicious  generous portions   value   And  they cook to order as long as they have the ingredients  Service is pretty good   the waiters are personable  knowledgeable    very accommodating   but so busy sometimes a little forgetful    Among a few dishes that really piqued our interest  we chose Beef   Four Cheese Rigatoni  Beef was tenderly braised  The dish was good  however it was too salty one time   we think we ll try it w a different pasta  Eggplant Manicotti is similar to a traditional eggplant rollatini  but maybe needs a little more creaminess   or more spice     Chicken Gorgonzola was interesting w chicken  spinach  asparagus  roasted red peppers   fettucini finished w an Alfredo sauce   Gorgonzola cheese  what a strong twist that adds   Mussels Marinara was ok  We will definitely return  To be continued   Lunch  dinner  Family style  take out  delivery    catering http

persistent follow up on my part via phone  in person  and social media  Thayer Nursery replaced   of the    original arborvitae at no cost to me   Hopefully the remaining original   don t merely survive  but eventually thrive   The other plants  while struggling initially this spring  perhaps because of the late planting and difficult winter  appear to be healthy and growing   These include   rohdodendron  boxwood  holly  japanese maple  blue spruce  dawn redwood  and various smaller plants   Josh is pleasant to work with    He explained that Thayer Nursery will no longer plant arborvitae

even the right number     and confirming reservations  haven t heard back in five days      Two stars  Maybe if I get to eat here I can review that  Wouldn t plan on coming here again due to the inefficiency booking a reso ',\n 'This place is freaking excellent  Our server Heidi was very prompt and polite  This is the second time visiting and the food was just as scrumptious as the first  Definitely recommend ',\n 'Food was decent  Appetizer and desert was good  But very disappointed with the entree  The cost was little high  Overall it was a pleasant experience ',\n 'We stopped by for some dessert after we had Indian food at Vij s  We wanted to get the snow mountains but unfortunately the machine wasn t working that night so we opted for a Nutella toastery  It was surprisingly very good  I originally expected it to be very heavy but to my surprise it was light and fluffy  As it was served on a hot plate  the cream melted and blended in with the dessert perfectly   We arrive at around      on a Sunday and there were plenty of seats available  The decor is cute and the environment is cozy  Would recommend ',\n 'Very knowledgeable and helpful   No need to prepare before you come  the staff knows everything and made the experience very enjoyable ',\n 'it was nice to go to food was okay',\n 'I discovered this place late in my Disney experiences  I had often heard about it and wanted to try it but never got around to it  Finally   years ago I made it to Citricos  I would rank this restaurant on the same tier as California Grill  at the Contemporary  and Narcoossee s  at the Grand Floridian as well    one of Disney s premier restaurants and in my honest opinion one of their best    The decor and atmosphere of Citricos is warm with greens and reds on the walls and carpet and low lighting  The dining area is split  one part is longer  thinner room which then opens up into a round dining room  Windows surround the perimeter which give nice views of the Grand Floridian grounds    The food is mostly Mediterranean  on my most recent trip I had a shrimp appetizer and chicken for dinner  I had a lemon raspberry cheesecake for dessert  Everything was delicious and presented beautifully    This is a favorite   definitely worth a try ',\n 'Great brisket  I highly recommend the more fatty of the briskets  as it is just so juicy and delicious and the creamed corn  which is a great accompaniment  The only thing holding me back from five stars is the fact that their BBQ sauce wasn t my favorite  Aside from that it was amazing  and I highly recommend ',\n 'This review of Vitality is way over due  maybe  I was trying to keep this fantastic place to myself    I am a former dancer and had to stop at the beginning of my career due to injuries  knees and back  that have plagued me ever since  I  basically stopped all physical activity  except for occasionally  joining some random club and going on exercise binges that left me re injured and unable to exercise and the the cycle started all over again  I was able to maintain my low body weight over the years  by basically not eating    Three years ago I had surgery for a torn rotator cuff  great  a new part of my body injured  After a year of PT   the shoulder was stable and I decided it was time to do something about my physical health and do it in a sane way  I really wanted to work with someone who would know how to work with my history of injuries and that I was approaching     I chose Vitality because I saw the owner was both an elite trainer and a physical therapist   The moment I walked into Vitality I felt good about the place  It was beautiful  bright and immaculate  Then I met with Shay  who owns Vitality  she is a positive force  She took the time to really get to know my medical history and asked pertinent questions about who I was and what I was looking for in my training  As soon as we started my first training  I felt confident that I was in the right place  This was an entire new way of working out for me  The personalization and variety of training modalities   attention to form detail and focus on my ability to function in my my daily life without chronic injury was something I had never experienced before  In addition   the encouragement and support of Shay  her staff and other clients made me want to keep going I have been to Vitality starting on three years now and train there up to   times a week   Training at Vitality has been a game changer for me I have never felt better physically and emotionally  stronger and happier with my body image and able to do my work  which is physical as I still work with the ballet at      I am eating so much healthier and look forward to working out  even my physician noticed the  improvement  in my muscle mass and over all condition   Shay carefully choses her other trainers and they are all excellent  Each one has great experience in training at the level I expect at Vitality and brings their own area of expertise  I also love  training with Sofie and Amanda  I highly recommend the group classes and wish I had joined them sooner  They are small  everyone in the class is supportive and the trainer leading the group knows you and modifies any of the exercises to your needs   I have given my athletic  data based executive  and personal training resistant husband  a Christmas gift of health  He could not believe how much Shay accomplished in one session he went back for more and his squash game improved immediately and he could not stop talking about how some chronic pain issues had resolved  I also refer my clients  pre professional ballet students  for functional assessment and training to help manage and prevent injuries that are associated with ballet and have them train in an  out of the ballet box  manner that will improve their ballet training   As you can tell  I fee very positive about this place  If you are looking for for cutting edge  and truly personal training in a supportive and beautiful place  go to Vitality  you will not be disappointed  You are not just another member  you are an individual that they really get to know and care about

restaurants inside the perimeter like the plague   But a few nights ago some friends decided to check it out and it s only    min from my place so why not   Street parking available if you can find it   There s some spots available right in front of the restaurant  but the traffic           Eh  it s downtown Decatur  what do you expect   We easily found street parking about a     min walk away   As for the food   UH MAY ZING  Our group of   ordered two Combo C s   Best chadol  brisket  I ve ever had  I m not usually a fan of chadol but there s something different about this one  I ve also got a weakness for marinated meat   their galbi and bulgogi were SO good and didn t disappoint   And then there s jumuluk       Which I ve actually never had before and I ate it and my mind was blown and I was upset that I went this long in my life not having tried it before and I was so sad that I had to share any with my friends  So yeah  it was good   All in all  I can confidently say I found my new go to KBBQ spot  Might be on the pricier side for some  but I ll gladly pay for the convenience of not driving all the way to Duluth and for much better quality meat ',\n 'If you love Hawaiian food  this is the place to go   Patrick s has everything from Lau Lau to Lomi Lomi Salmon to Kalua Pork   Plus  the BEST teriyaki chicken I ve ever had   Patrick  the owner  won t give out the recipe though  it s grandma s secret and he told my husband she d make him do dishes if he gave it out   Husband said he d do them for the recipe     Besides the teriyaki chicken  I have to have the coconut shrimp and my husband always gets the Kalbi beef   The macaroni salad is a true Hawaiian macaroni salad with potatoes in it   Plus  it wouldn t be right not to end the meal with an order of Haupia   I just wish they offered something beside corn as the vegetable   Service is always great though and there s soft live music on the weekends to enjoy while you eat   Oh  they also have a lighter menu for those who don t want quite so much to eat  All in all one of our favorite places in Vancouver ',\n 'SO GOOD  If you have allergies or live a plant based lifestyle this place is a dream  The staff is

and I enjoyed it  it s right on the belt line near a brewery  so we were able to get free parking on a street and walked up  So you don t have to valet if you don t want to you just might have to walk a bit  The place was packed on a friday  It s pretty dark and loud so you can t hear too much across the table  We got the calamari to start   SO good and was huge  I could have eaten the whole thing for a main meal  I got the pork belly which was amazing  the pork was very fatty pieces but I enjoyed that  My bf got the lobster and it was pretty good for    bucks  Overall satisfied  On the pricier side but would recommend for a date night ',\n 'Great wings   as always  We love the half garlic pepper and half buffalo wings   pad thai  and their Vietnamese grilled meats on rice or noodles   Love

decision  Scant a customer  laughable misspelt menu   Jasmine rice was pretty lackluster  Definitely far from the best curry I ve had but    it wasn t the worst either    I will say that our waitress  who could have been one of the owners   was so sweet   and really thorough with questions we asked   I think I d be willing to go back if I ever had a hankering for Thai in the area             yet would probably opt for mild next time  P',\n 'Love this store  Wei is best sales here and provide me great ideas  and all other sales are also nice and helpful ',\n 'Hey  what can I say  it s A OK   When I walked in around      on a weekday you could hear crickets in this place  A bit sad  as it had a cool vibe and I ve heard good things about their food and drinks  It s very cool how the patio seating is essentially an extension of the indoors  and it was a lovely summer day so I decided to sit on the deck    The service was great  save for the gal sitting at the bar and rolling silverware the entire hour I was there  ignoring every person that walked in the door   and there were two really attentive and friendly servers on the patio making sure everyone was taken care of  The HH menu wasn t all that great for both food and drinks  so we all opted for their inventive and reasonably priced burgers    I love that a lot of the substitutes were free of charge  I got the Vesuvius burger with a vegan patty  First off  this burger is ridiculous  We re talking jalepenos  pepper jack cheese  grilled onions  and chipotle chutney  YUM  But the patty really is where everything went wrong  and is why I have to give this   stars  It was runny  folks  So runny that there was no way I could have picked up the burger  While I m really pleased that they make their own vegan patty and don t just slap a frozen puck in the microwave  they need to tweak their recipe for sure  The chips were overall very good although a few were a bit soggy  and that gorg dipping sauce is amazing   I have high hopes for this place  While I don t think I ll ever be getting a vegan patty again  I m willing to come back and order something else off the menu ',\n 'Great subs  always the best roast beef',\n

i like the food  even though some say they need salt and pepper  but this is what food is supposed to taste like for our bodies to maximize the nutrients  we are just all so used to weighed down heavy flavored food that this seems bland  i myself love it  i never feel too full when i leave  even if i have seconds  youll know the difference when you go to the cheesecake factory or trudys  ect  when

be ready to order  We were sat at a table in about    mins    Wait  this is where it gets tricky  We were sat at a table and asked to move to a table in the corner because the table wasn t ready  No problem we re not comfortable but moved from a view of the outside to no view in the corner  whatever I m hungry  They will be right with you was what the hostess said  I declined the menu because I already knew what we were going to order  We wait and wait and wait finally I start to look for any waitress or waiter I mean someone  I can t grab anyone s attention because they Are tending to other

I had to take back  which they were very nice about they didn t sit and inspect the foreign object in my plate  they just replaced my bowl and apologized  My coworker ordered another thing and it came with an egg roll but she was able to substitute it for spring rolls which were really delicious  I think u like enjoy this place if I would ve ordered pho  everyone ordered around me had it  It s very affordable and a huge overwhelming menu ',\n 'Dr  Rob is incredibly calm  patient  and compassionate  while also being enthusiastic about his practice   He does whatever he can to help me   I m a little nervous about chiropractic and he has a wonderful way of working with me that calms my nerves   I love the combo of massage and chiro  as well as craniosacral    as he has a feel for both soft tissue and bony structures  Also  he is always sure to follow treatments up with general exercises to help the client  maintain  the adjustments he has given   As a Physical Therapist Assistant  I appreciate this aspect of his care   I ve recommended him to many of my friends  who have also had incredible experiences in his hands ',\n 'I can not say enough how much I love this place   I moved here after living in LA and SF and literally wanted to cry with happiness upon my first bite  Their Carnitas is on point  fresh homemade tortillas  even the gringo taco was excellent  Mexican food  specifically tacos and burritos in Portland have been such sad disappointment to me that when my coworker took me to this magical taco land I never wanted to leave   ever so I will be back next week  and the week after that   ',\n 'I must admit that there is not much left to say about this restaurant   After registering at the hotel  it was our next stop   Had to eat at a place in existence this long   The chowder was tasty  but not the best and the oyster stew was watery with a just put together flavor   The scrod with mashed and slaw was tasty  but tiny for the price and the salad with grilled shrimp just ok  I liked the people  but just found the experience less that it should have been ',\n 'Two drive through windows at this location and they use an interesting conveyor belt to get the food order to the outside window  Very clever   Inside the restaurant  busy of course  But the staff are always friendly and smiling and happy to refill your soda without question   Grilled chicken sandwiches are available for those of us who want to shave off a few calories  but how can I resist the wonderful waffle fries  And there were TWO ladies with trays of those brownies to sample  so I managed to get one from each  Oops   Follow the clearly painted lines in the parking lot  It s not difficult ',\n 'This is one of them restaurants which you may walk by and say  Meh   but if you do go in and try out the menu  it is pretty good  This restaurant was mentioned in a Georgia Straight article as a place to go try out  I think it was the year before   not sure   I ve come here many times  and you may need a little caution patience on Friday nights as it might be hard to get in then ',\n 'Wonderful family business  Delicious food in a  quiet atmosphere ',\n 'What a place  Told them I m from or of town from the ATL and everyone shouted hey welcome Atlanta  Great food lived they let you sample stuff  I will def be back when I come down  My son loved it too  Good old fashion Texas BBQ ',\n 'Hands down the best in town  I m surprised that there are quite a few reviews with low rating  Their bowl of pho is so fresh and tasty it literally makes you go oh my goodness  And the quality is very consistent  I ve been going since it opened and it never disappoints me  THE BEST ',\n 'I ve just put a freeze on my account   So that is my first good thing to say about this place  Because it was so easy to do   I grappled with whether or not do this  but let s face it I really hadn t stepped foot in the place for at least a few months if not more  I m not a fan of machines  Period  I thought the televisions would make it easier for me  But after awhile that too got old   If  it s nice out and summer I d rather just walk or jog outside  But that can be said of any gym   What I really love are group classes  They are fun and stimulating to me  I m into step classes and although the ones at Healthworks are good  they just aren t the same as the ones at Bally s right around the corner   I don t know what it is  The instructor s  The music selection  The people in the class itself  But if I want to do a step class I d rather do it at Bally s  where coincidentally I pay an obscenely low membership rate  I was actually going to Bally s AND to Healthworks for awhile  just so i could have Bally s step classes   Still if I was going to work out on machines or do weights I d much rather do it at Healthworks  Cleaner  better machines  less crowded  and no men   One of the things that really pulled me to this place was the wet area and locker room   The locker room can t be beat    I ve belonged to a number of gyms and I am very very picky when it comes to showers   I would never for the love of God take one at Bally s  but here at Healthworks I would  Until now      Something changed  Yes they upgraded  but way too often I would walk into a stall and find someones wet hair clumped on the bottom of the shower  Its was gross to say the least  Couldn t they have someone more regularly clean out the showers or at least put up a sign that says clean up after your nasty self when you finish a shower   Then there is the whirlpool   I ll admit I was enjoying it in the nude like everyone else for a while  And I actually appreciated that everyone did this and it was nice to just have women around being comfortable and relaxed around one another   But then there came a point when the thought of going in that thing started to not be so appealing   As previous reviewers said so delicately   it s just kind of nasty with all those bare vaginas   Love the steamroom though  Seems like gyms always have saunas but not steamrooms  No complaints about it  Btw if you want more steam  take some water and pour it over that stick that is sticking out of the furthest wall   Cool place  but for now I just can t justify the price  especially if I wasn t using the place ',\n 'Very good place to enjoy a great rock roll and hangout with friends  I got there early to eat and chat and later the band took the stage and my ears were delighted ',\n 'Just FYI   Top Dog Car wash in Sanford  Lake Mary and Melbourne is now Mister Carwash  New owners  new staff  and not friendly   Good news is there are   more Top Dogs  one in Altamonte       and     by Golden Coral and Oviedo and Lake Nona area ',\n 'I decided to give Dr  Snow   Co  a try after reading about the raving Yelp reviews on here about how awesome their facility   staff were  As I called to make an appointment  I was informed that the next available opening would be two months out  I hesitated as I glanced down the reviews and decided to give them a try    All good comes to those who wait    right    I was greeted warmly by the receptionist upon arrival  as she promptly handed me the appropriate paperwork to fill out  As I was working on filling in the blanks  I noticed how much I liked the warmth of their waiting room  The room was designed to mirror a living room  and with its neutral colored decor and comfortable seating arrangements  I didn t feel like I was waiting at all    Five or seven minutes after finishing my paperwork a petite lady pushes open the office door beckoning to welcome me in  She introduced herself as  Veronica     After seating myself comfortably in the beige dentist s chair  Veronica proceeded to take x rays of my teeth  Now let me take a moment to credit just how through the job was done  She took at least    x rays positioning the machine at different angles  In all of my years of going to the dentist  I ve never experienced such detail orientation     After reviewing the x rays with me  Veronica then proceeded to cleanse my teeth  Given that the last time I visited a dentist was   years ago  I was long overdue for a good cleaning  Again  I couldn t help but notice through cleansing how meticulous she was at her job  She made sure to clean every nook and cranny between my teeth  while stopping twice to ask me if I needed a break  which again  is another first for a dentist visit     Dr  Snow appears shortly after my cleaning to perform a final inspection on my teeth  His warmheartedness put my nerves at ease as we reviewed my x rays  and as he examined my cleaned teeth     After experiencing the cleaning that I had  I would definitely recommend Dr  Snow and Veronica to everyone ',\n 'Yay Shag  Have you ever had one of those phases where you spent like   months straight memorizing and being constantly tested on hundreds of powerpoint slides  worth of factoids about diseases and wound care  highly

Shag  in all of my stress acned glory  I came in looking like absolute hell  and I looked like a movie star when Jared was done with my hair  a movie star with a lot of acne  but you can t have it all   Jared is as fantastic as everyone claims  the hair cut is super feminine and stylish  and he cut it to suit my face  not trivial  I m usually dwarfed by my hair   The space is really nice  a huge sun filled loft  super hip and friendly people  Oh  and Jared also gave me really practical advice about styling my hair  usually that stuff goes in one ear and out the other  but he was good at explaining a few little easy and sensible tricks that I can use for blow drying ',\n 'I purchased a groupon for a keratin treatment a few months back   Having had the process done before at a different location I knew my hair should respond well to the procedure   The owner applied the treatment  and then set about  flat ironing it   My hair was frizzy the entire time   it didn t look like that last time   I tossed it off as it being a different formulation and figured if i waited the prescribed time it would look fine   It didn t  It actually looked no different and became difficult to manage   I waited a while and treated it with the keratin infusin treatment  i had at home  salon bought  still nothing   Biggest waste of        Though the lady was nice I wouldn t go back ',\n 'busy

Not going to waste a lot of space here since there are plenty of reviews  but the only reason I take a star off is that it s usually wayyyyy too crowded and you may have to wait quite a while   It s a small complaint though   Generally speaking  it s worth it   Prices are reasonable and the pizza is excellent ',\n 'Gave it one more shot  horrible experience once again  Owner was an ass hat  rushed us along the whole time and is a jerk to the diners and staff  Really nice looking place  too bad it is ruined by guy  STAY AWAY unless Armando is not there ',\n 'the aroma when you walk in is probably worth   stars    i have no idea how to pronounce anything in this place but the raisin thing a ma jig i had the other morning was FABULOUS   much better signage now but i think some people still might not realize what a little gem of a place this is   GO THERE   NOW ',\n 'Oh fish box how I love thee  I ve been going here since they opened   And go probably once a week  The poke tacos

something that would disgust vegetarians more  I don t think so    Is it possible to disgust a vegetarian more than I did when showing my girlfriend the photo of my medium rare burger from Mooo      Not without getting slapped    I was strolling around this part of Boston on a solo mission on Labor Day and knew nothing about this place  I actually happened upon it when I was headed somewhere else for a burger  but knew this was where I wanted to go after I saw the name of the establishment and the fact there was a    oz pub burger on their menu   I bellied up to the bar and ordered a burger medium rare  What came out was certainly on the rare side of medium rare  but I would still say cooked properly  other than one edge that had all the life cooked out of it   The fries were incredibly crisp through the whole meal and you simply couldn t beat the juiciness of the monster burger    If you re looking for beef  and to disgust vegetarians  come to Mooo    ',\n 'The food and service is top shelf   They have great wine selection  too  It can get a bit loud inside the restaurant but then again that s because it s full of people   Try the foie gras as a dessert   so yummy ',\n 'So they deliver late on weekends and their pizza is amazing  Anytime I visit Orlando I try to at lease have flippers pizza once  I m usually a pepperoni or sausage pizza type of girl but their cheese pizza is great ',\n 'This place is such a waste of time and money  They double book the soccer field for the third time in a row  To say the least this place is poorly managed and absolutely outrages on pricing  No one gives a a F   K about anyone  I would not recommend this location for those reasons ',\n 'as far as vegiterian goes  this place takes the cake  and i mean something for anyone    very

place to get something if you know pretty much exactly what you are looking for ',\n 'Booked my appointment online about the week prior   I selected the    pm window and provided details  of the items to be taken   They called the day before to confirm the appointment and go over the items I had for pickup   He was really nice and told me that they could take my computer monitors but it would be a extra     each or I could take them to BestBuy for free   Glad he shared this information with me  I opted to take them to BestBuy later   They actually called about  pm on the day of and said they could come early if I was home if not they could wait for the appointment window  I let him know that I had to run out at      for about    minutes but they could come over  He said they could work on the stuff outside while I ran out so   I had them just come on over    The franchise owner   two workers showed up   They were very nice  clean cut  looked like professional with the matching uniforms   We did a quick walk through and they provided a estimate  I had nearly a full truck load of bulky junk  the estimate   was      for all of it    I actually had to drop my wife at the BostonExpress shuttle at     pm   Hench  the    pm window selected originally   So  I left them to start on the driveway and gave them permission to work on the basement too via the exterior bulkhead door   When I got back they were nearly done    I think it might have taken them maybe    minutes to clear everything   I did a walk through with one of the guys they did great and even swept up the basement floor after   They had a automatic credit card reader and provided a receipt    The price seems high at first glance but after talking with other companies people it was really reasonable  I liked they had clear estimates  nice   professional workers and were fast   I would hire them again ',\n 'Went here for brunch  and for some drinks and apps at the bar at night on a separate occasion    This place really does have a hotel feel about all of it   if you can get past a bit of that  then you are golden  because the food is pretty good   French toast for brunch   possibly best in Boston here   Sticky buns   better at Flour   Omelet just OK   would avoid   but potatoes were delish   Coffee was solid nice hotel coffee  but I ve had better   Not many fellow diners when we came   Things were a little more happening at dinner at the restaurant   we ate at the bar  which was quite fun  but again a distinctly  hotel  feel   maybe this place is best more for locals doing the hotel bar thing as opposed to a first time meet and greet ',\n 'Islands of Adventure is wicked twin sister of Universal Studios  From the outside it looks the same  but inside they are completely different   If Universal Studios was a quiet Christian girl  Islands of Adven is the high school drop out that started stripping at     It is filled with thrills and excitement  not to mention there are beer stands at every corner    There are tons of roller coasters and thrill rides to keep the kids happy  They have several areas for the little ones to play and get wet  This is my favorite theme park in Orlando

EASTER CUPCAKES    Oh yes  we quickly did a rewind and backed it up right into Lulu s Bake Shoppe    Everywhere you go is temptation upon temptation  Oh sweet dessert gods  which cupcake shall I choose   Chocolate  Red Velvet  Vanilla  Carrot cake   I went with the traditional one with a spunky Easter spring touch of icing to it   Some had just come out of the oven so I sat down with my latte with Travel Partner A and B to wait   Okay  sorry I m from New York   after about  minutes I thought  hmmm   maybe they forgot   let me casually inquire   And noooooo I was not New York sassy either   But they were soooo nice about it  And so apologetic   Hello  Not that serious  I m on VACATION baby  I got aaaaaall the time in the woooorld  But apparently they felt so bad we got a free cake out of it   Um  Okay   Everything was delicious  the vanilla cupcake and cake however were definitely heavy on the butter  so be prepared  Mmm  Sweet tooth fix ',\n 'Austin  our server  was very friendly and helpful  The food was very good  We ll come back ',\n 'I need this in my life  If I lived in Vancouver  this would be my go to place for all manner of things   Let s talk about the  being open    hours   I m a morning person  And when I fly from the East Coast to Vancouver  I m even more of one  So on my first morning of my last trip to Vancouver  I was up before    I went for a walk and stopped in here for a delicious breakfast scone and hot tea   I ve been several times since and the food is always delicious   The physical space managed to strike just the right blend of open concept but somehow not so open that it s always loud    The folks behind the counter  Super nice  Easy to deal with  I say as someone who was overtired and jet lagged and wandering in at      a m      Looking forward to my next visit to Vancouver so I came come here again ',\n 'Backcountry Pizza really hit it out of the park tonight   Their poutine s gravy was just the right smooth consistency and full of beef  pork  and duck flavor and cheese  I m guessing Gruyere  melted right into the fries without being overbearing   When the chicken parmesan over pasta arrived       I was surprised that it had three large strips of chicken   The chicken was covered in melted cheese  which was perfect for this dish   The service was courteous and fast ',\n 'An observation I made since moving here is that Oregonians obviously do not know what a good burger is supposed to taste like  The Giant is a landmark little shack in Lake Oswego which is a stand alone building  The place is either super packed or super empty  There is no happy median here  Anywho  I had to check what all the buzz was about    When we drove up  I couldn t help but imagine I was at some old beat up diner in the middle of nowhere in a horror flick  I was waiting for Freddy or Jason to jump out of the bushes and chase me down the street  After I got over this fear  I headed into the restaurant  I opted for a simple double cheeseburger and fries because that s why I was at a burger joint    Well my friends  sorry to disappoint  but the burger was a huge disappointment  It was flavorless  The patties were small and the only thing I could taste was the cheese and veggies  The meat has no beef flavor whatsoever  WHERE S THE BEEF   As I was nearing the final third of the burger  I noticed the meat was gone and I was left with bread  The patties were way too small for the enormous bun so you ll be left with bread    I truly cannot fathom how people actually gave this place   stars  Quite frankly  even something like Carl s Jr  tastes better in my opinion  McD s is a block away and I d rather eat a quarter pounder from there than to eat another Giant again ',\n 'First stop when we got into Boston  Late arrival  popped off the metro on the way to the hotel and meandered here off the reviews  Got a lobster roll  shrimp roll  lobster corn chowder  root beer  and some blueberry lemonade  Staff was very friendly  it was close to closing and it was a small place    The lobster roll was good  a little sweet with a warm and slightly crispy roll  Definitely a good start to the trip for me  I always forget the lobster itself is cold on these but it tasted great nonetheless    The shrimp roll was much the same  A little sweet  small pieces of shrimp but piled high  It comes cold in a warm roll  as is basically the norm  But my wife really enjoyed it and the few bites I had were great   It was a chilly night so the lobster corn chowder was very welcome  Excellent flavor  good chunks of seafood in it  This is the exact thing you want when looking at it on the menu and it did not disappoint    Also got a bag of chips  I believe  exactly what you would expect   The blueberry lemonade was surprising  All the flavors came through    honey  blueberry  lemon    in different bursts  I did not expect that but it was very welcome  Root beer was root beer  light on ingredients but not on taste    Overall  as they say  it is expensive  Paid about     for everything and considering the portion sizes  that is a little expensive but since it is seafood and downtown it is priced according to location  We left satisfied  not overly full    TL DR  Mmm    food ',\n 'Having only dabbled at dance in the past  the negative reviews here made me a little nervous  But I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun I had though I only had     of the choreography down  My advice  don t just try to only master  the moves  but also remember to count  If you re counting and don t know the moves just make something up  Don t expect to learn the whole routine your first time  today is my third time and I finally got     of it down  Just dance it out and have fun  D',\n 'This place is the cutest  It is so cozy in here   Location      It is located right next to the North Market near the parking garage  So it s actually in the best and most convenient place it can be   Environment       The inside is so adorable with a very chic flare to it  and there is comfortable spacing here  It s very cozy   Prices      Their prices are a little steep  but just remember what you are getting  quality  Their chocolate bars are about   dollars  and their hot drinks start at around   dollars    Desserts Drinks      I got their dark chocolate bar  It had raspberry  blueberries  coco nibs  and some type of edible flower  When I first tried it  I didn t know how I felt about it  But the more I got into the bar  the more I feel in love with it  It was very satisfying and lasted me the whole day  you only need a couple of bites  I also got a tea latte here with almond milk  It was okay  it didn t wow me too much  but I definitely did drink it all  I would maybe try their chai the next time I came in   Service      Since this was the first time of me being here  I was eager to know more about their products before purchasing  The staff here helped me so much and helped me pick out a chocolate based on my likes dislikes  It was a match made it heaven  They were very helpful and didn t seem bothered that I had a lot of questions    Overall      I love everything about this place  and all it has to offer  The location down to the quality of their products are exceptional  I will definitely return here ',\n 'Extremely good service and the food came very quickly and on time  If you are looking for

'I used to be a patron of Barracuda because cheap drinks and pretty good bar food but after tonight i will likely never return   I met The Boy here for a drink with his friends  They had been there already for an hour or two  I ordered a drink with my friend that I came with on a separate bill  When our two drinks were served The Boy and his friends attempted to order another round  I tuned out after hearing the beer they were trying to order wasn t cold yet so they began discussing other beers available and the next thing I knew   minutes later   The Boy was cut off but his friends got served  By no means was anyone in our party being disruptive  rude  or misbehaving in a way that would illicit being cut off   I understand the right to refuse service but The Boy was the one who had his card down so he asked for the check for his group of    prepared to continue our nIght elsewhere  I believe at this point   after realizing they had cut off the person who would be signing for the bill  things went awry  The Boy was presented a      check with tip already included and they refused to remove the included gratuity   We attempted to ask for a manager and were told we could come back tomorrow and ask for Sara  We then attempted to ask for the server s name and she said her name conveniently was also Sara  I tried to ask for them to show me in writing their policy that for a party of   even   or more that gratuity will be charged automatically  a practice that i thought was pretty standard    she told me I didn t need to see it  I have been here before with a party of   for food and drinks and we were not charged gratuity on our bill automatically   She then said the doorman  who admitted it was his first day   i find it hard to believe you have new employees starting and no manager available  would escort me out and ran away unwilling to provide me her name  I called the bar upon leaving to see if I could reach a manager named Sara  I believe our server

experienced such rude and dishonest service before ',\n 'Libby Wyatt is the best stylist I ve ever had    I have super thick  curly hair  and no stylist I have gone to before has cut it in a way that

feel right at home   Her place is a quaint lil place on the East side of Austin  Prices are decent  comparable to any place in the Austin area  Sometimes I wish I was an esthetician  They bank     I also really like the product she uses   It s a pink hard wax   Once she puts it on the skin  she let s it harden a little before pulling the wax off   The pain that I thought I would endure was  painless  compared to soft wax and sugaring   Totally sold me  Y all should definitely try hard waxing if you have not   Thank me later ladies   ',\n 'Mooo    is a hotel restaurant  but does not carry the stereotype that follows   This restaurant is easily one of the top  if not the top steakhouse in Boston   Their wine list is nationally acclaimed and their servers are very knowledgeable when it comes to pairings   We started with the Kobe dumplings and those were beyond incredible   For dinner we had the fillet and the bone in Delmonico   These were perfectly cooked and the bone marrow butter complimented it well   Portion size here can justify the price being paid as they are quite large   Modern  dark decor with a lively atmosphere and top notch service all around   If Mooo    falls out of your price range  their Restaurant Week lunch menu  March and August  gives you a solid taste of their offerings   Reservations it appeared were tough to come by on the weekends so do plan accordingly ',\n 'HOLY COW  This food is incredible  Sometimes being vegan results in less choices but driving through from CO to VT I was lucky enough to find this place and am beyond thankful for nutritious food that I can take on the go  The fact that they make online ordering a breeze  so I knew exactly how long my pit stop was going to take  was even more appreciated  I ve only dug into their homemade beet kraut with carrot hummus toast but I can only expect that my curried chickpeas and bbq jackfruit will be just as exceptional ',\n 'This place is the perfect location  Only about       minutes downtown and is walking distance to Target  Publix  Starbucks  and sooo much more  All appliances are updated and with granite type counter tops  It s super secure because it s gated and requires a code or scanned key to access  We love it here and Michelle G is the best  We moved from Missouri and she made our transition super easy and exceeded our expectations ',\n 'Wow  Super dope service  Walked in at       saw   people walking around in the kitchen  made eye contact with one  then they proceeded to ignore us for the next    minutes when we just left    Not really sure what their problem is other than they wanted to close but we would have easily left by   or been happy to order to go ',\n 'Great food and beer selection  Burger night is the best  Don t miss the homemade chips  Good atmosphere inside  very nice patio on the outside for the warm weather ',\n 'Tried this place for the first time today  I saw the good reviews but it surpassed my expectations  Flavors were great  staff was the best  and hand pulled noodles were just too good to be true  I m glad I discovered this place  not even far from my home or work  I will be back frequently ',\n 'I went here this Sunday after climbing in Eldo   It was packed  as usual this time of the week   but the staff were efficient at clearing the tables without rushing patrons  I m not a beer drinker so I can t speak to that  but the veggie chili was quite good and I am planning to return for the Cubano sandwich  I prefer the more eclectic atmosphere at the Dark Horse but you can t go wrong with either ',\n 'The best seafood restaurant  Period  I have been coming here for many years and every meal is perfectly cooked and their style is pure and healthy  The fish is so fresh  best integrity of all fish restaurants in terms of fish   quality  This is the real deal  The service is incredible and sitting at the bar is a good time ',\n 'I went here with my partner and a friend  it was less than great service  The food was Ok  but it took forever for it to come out  We were having some tapas  and it took so long for the food to come out  that we nixed the idea of ordering anything else  There was a table near us with some new customers  after sitting there for    minutes someone finally came to their table and asked if anyone had waited on them yet  The wait staff was inattentive and very unorganized  The owner was sitting with friends having some food and drinks  and was completely disregarding that fact that his restaurant is going down in flames  Such a shame that such a great location for a restaurant is being wasted with this mess of an establishment ',\n 'We went with our family to eat dinner and celebrate Easter   We got there before the rest of our party and sat at the bar   The bartender was great and the drinks were good   Once we were seated it went downhill from there   The service was extremely slow and we couldn t understand why because the place was empty  Once we got our meals some of them were cold   We had to get up and grab our waitress to get our checks   It was the worst experience we ve had at this location   Not sure we ll be back',\n 'I changed my mind   Maybe I just had a weird pizza  because every one we ve gotten since has actually been pretty rad   They know us now  actually  because we can t stay away from it    my review just went up a star  however  I want to know what is going on with the theoretical ice cream joint occupying the back half that is all papered off    spooky  ',\n 'Delicious    We had the kimchi fries burrito  beef bulgolgi burger with egg  pork bulgolgi tacos and beef bulgolgi tacos    and a side of garlic fries   Fries were like regular fries   wish we got the kimchi fries instead   Kimchi fries burrito was satisfying   I only wish the kimchi was more traditional  meaning spicier and more sour   And I bet it would be awesome with a fried egg inside   Will definitely try again   The burger  omg  I m making at home every weekend  At least try to   The bun was soft  meat tender and sweet  gooey egg   just wonderful   The tacos I didn t care for because of the corn tortillas  I prefer flour  And I thought the portion was a bit small being that everything was same price  but my husbands favorite   He got in line for seconds   Service was so welcoming   Above and beyond nice  ',\n 'When I get homesick  as with the rest of my Filipino family  one thing we do is find a place that serves authentic Filipino food  and that means food that is usually sautéed  a bit too oily or too salty for a foreigners taste  like lechon  binagoongan  bopis  etcetera  Max s serves exactly what we are looking for  but a bit pricey  So far  I haven t eaten anything from their menu that displeases me  One big problem though is the very limited parking  considering it is located in a very busy street  and they have limited sitting  especially considering that Filipinos love to eat out  in big groups  and often find occasions to do so ',\n 'Finally an authentic Thai restaurant  The food here is really good and they have sticky rice  Their service is excellent and the food comes out quick  Give this place a try you won t regret it ',\n 'Awesome venue and great place for perfectly mixed cocktails  This place is now one of my favorite bars in Austin  You can just let staff know what flavors or liquor your in the mood for and they will not disappoint  I had a perfect gin martini ',\n 'If you re in search of the perfect light cheese cake then this is your answer  I stumbled upon this place as I was walking along Robson st  curious I just thought it was just one of those cheesecakes and that they all taste the same   So we ordered the cheese cake bites in a tin foil   it has this sort of like our crust then a warm cheesecake on top    When you bite into it you taste that warm cheese oozing out then there s this sweet and salty taste which is sooooooo delicious when it s warm  My husband and I both had that ohhhh this is so good moment  They also have that airy cheesecake for        I think  and it s a good size for sharing or bringing to parties  It s not too small nor too big  Just the right size to bring to a small gathering  I love this place and I m so glad they have one along Robson  It s a must try for cheesecake lovers and soon to be ones  I highly recommend it and the price point too is so good   Will add more pics again of both the bites and the whole cake ',\n 'Chicken Satay is the best around  Friendly  good prices   hours and yummy yummy food ',\n 'Best new restaurant of            Hip  modern  unpretentious  and the best damn food   drinks this side of San Francisco or New York  Looking forward to many return visits  Highlights include the short rib pizza  any of the bourbon based cocktails  and a great wine list ',\n 'I had been coming here for the last few years and was a happy customer  Recently  I sent a package to a usual address in California  The clerk entered the address incorrectly  which caused a delay  UPS received the correct info but it was returned back to Watertown  They just expected me to repay to send it  Never going back ',\n 'Officially  the worst food I ve ever had  Not only they forgot to put cheese in my  Steak   Cheese  sub  the meat was so dry  it was nearly impossible to eat  I actually made sure to otder EXTRA CHEESE  and there was not an ounce of cheese in the sub   The staff is unfriendly and not helpful at all when I called to complain about the food   Needless to say  I will never return there again ',\n 'The good part  Very cute  and a nostalgic      s diner complete with what looks like the same people that opened it years ago  Conveniently located on Boones Ferry Rd in Lake Oswego with plenty of easy parking and never crowded    The bad part  Now I know why theres never a line  Disappointed in their quality  and the way they arrange their prices to rip you off   I ordered a plain cheeseburger  small fries and a small vanilla malt  My bill came to         Heres how they got me with my       cheeseburger    When I wanted jalapeños added  Instead of charging     or      or even a dollar for a few pickled jalapeños   they conveniently didn t allow me to add them  They switched my burger order to the  jalepeno burger  which is        That one comes with spicy salsa   I didn t want any of that  Just a plain cheeseburger  with a few jalepenos added to it  Should not have cost me an additional    for a few pickled jalepenos   Their meat patty is very generic  their shaved whitish cheese is sparse and it comes partially melted    Its another      for fries  which is fair but keep in mind  you can get an actual gourmet Jalapeño Pepper Jack Burger with Melted pepper jack cheese  jalapeños  Tabasco onion strings  fresh guacamole and chipotle aioli for         with fries  at Thirsty Lion   Second  I made the mistake of ordering a small vanilla malt and not checking the price  It was         There was absolutely nothing special about it  or the burger   I love the idea of supporting a local homegrown business  Especially one thats nostalgic like this  But honestly  just beware  Im sad to say that they are tricky with their upchages  which take them far out of their price range for the quality that they offer    Sorry Giant  I wont be back either ',\n 'My friend and I decided to give the Twisted Fork a try last Friday and we both agreed that we ve found a new downtown favorite   The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived around    But we were lucky enough to take the last empty table inside  Our waitress was fabulous  It was our first time so we asked a bunch of questions about the drinks and dinner menu  Not only did she patiently answered all our questions  she also made special request to the bartender so we know what bitters taste like before making our drink selections  We shares the mussels for appy  absolutely awesome  the cream sauce was so amazing it made   carb concious girls finished the   full dinner rolls because it goes so well with bread  I had the confit chicken salad  which was very flavorful and the amount of dressing was just right  My friend ordered the lamb shank and let me sampled some and I loved it  With so many fancy restaurants serving fancy plate at over     a bite  we were very impressed with the portion and the price at this cozy little spot  entrées btwn           We wanted to try their desserts but were both too full after our main dish  But the chef was kind enough to offer us a spoon full of their popular chocolate terrine  What a tease  Nothing finishes a perfect meal like chocolate mousse and rasberry sorbet     So yes  we ll definitely go back again  ',\n 'TARGET in downtown Portland   I do admit  a few of the items are priced higher  but it was nice to have a TARGET closeby   Some items aren t in stock in this location  but thats fine   Customer Service was great   Everyone was nice and helpful   There is a Starbucks at the lower level and an eating area as well   We brought food from the the food carts across the street and had Starbucks   and they use Paper Bags instead of plastic     we walked to TARGET  but i assume there should parking somewhere ',\n 'What a fantastic venue   I can t emphasize enough how awesome this place is   I ve been to a number of varied events here  but the free form accepting community atmosphere is always present ',\n 'We were excited to try Lenoir and it s pretty special  Unfortunately  I spat my food back on the plate  It was  allegedly  antelope  I wouldn t know  but it WAS stringy  dry  tough  sinewy  chewy  room temperature  and didn t taste very good either    Dessert earned this place a second star  Maybe we should try again with just the wine and dessert   ',\n 'Had a reservation on March   th at this location after there were no cars at the     location  I showed up and the front door glass was broken all over the floor  I was hoping this location could solve my problem and get me a car  After going through and explaining the poor service I had received at the other location  the employee with a smile   believe it or not  informed me that they did not have any cars either  He did advise me that I could wait in their lobby of glass shards for an hour and a half and they may have something for me   that was a great solution to the problem  What is the business model here  What I have learned today    you can rent from Enterprise  but don t be Surprised when they let you down ',\n 'The second time we tried to use Lynn  she forgot to put us on her schedule   My dog was locked in her cage for    hours without food or a bathroom  and only one bowl of water      I didn t find out  obviously  until we returned and did not find a note about the visits   Lynn never fully apologized or took full responsibility   Instead  she said that we didn t email back after she responded to my booking request with a confirmation email so she didn t put us on the schedule   She also claimed she tried to reach out via email but never cared enough to call to double check   Bottom line  we emailed and got her confirmation in writing and she never showed up   I feel so badly for my poor dog   So far she is fine and hopefully won t have a UTI   Don t let this happen to your dog  there are too many reliable dog sitters around   I won t be trusting this one again ',\n 'Children to the left of me Chinese to the right  here I am stuck in the middle with you   Of course I love children and Chinese   It s not that at all   It s just that both tables were LOUD   THIS LOUD   They were hurting my ears   And the Stealers Wheel lyrics seemed to fit the occasion     I think my husband won the menu selection award again   He had the sesame fish  tilapia  and won ton soup as an appetizer   His soup had giant won tons floating about   At least three were crammed in to the small cup of soup   And his platter of rice and tilapia was really quite delicious   Whereas  my miso soup tasted bland and it separated  It turned into a cup with a floating clear liquid on top and a murky grainy liquid on the bottom  I love Basil Chicken and prefer it with white sauce rather than the typical brown sauce   Our server said that would not be a problem  It was good but did not have the jalapenos or even the spicy kick I m used to finding in this dish   When I inquired  our server graciously took it back and the cook added them     My green tea was very weak so I asked if I could have the tea bag to steep it and she also kindly provided that to me   I m not usually this hard to please but there were a number of glitches on this night   Every request was met with a smile which gave them the third star ',\n 'Had the egg bacon breakfast sandwich   It was pretty good  especially the bread ',\n 'Hostess service could be better   Chefs and servers do a great job  Food is very good ',\n 'It may just be that this place is a mile away from my house  but we eat here more than any other restaurant in Atlanta  EPCT has amazing food  their fish tacos and fry platter with chilli sauce and sour cream are to die for   My favorite menu item is their shrimp po  boy  but they took it off the menu  BRING IT BACK    Karaoke is always a hit on Saturday night  but get there early to find a seat  Trivia Tuesday is another good time   can t go wrong with gift certificates for winning  Plus  you get service from really nice people  What s not to love ',\n 'I had always wanted to try Blue Baker  so friend and I went for lunch  It wasn t crowded  and the staff was friendly and helpful  I ordered a turkey sandwich with mayo on a croissant  and a cup of tomato basil soup   The table was dirty  okay  not that big of a deal  but they WEREN T BUSY   The soup was thin  pale  and so tasteless that I d be surprised if it had any tomato in it  let alone basil  The turkey meat was rubbery  slimy  AND tasteless   basically inedible   so I took it out and had a the slightly tough croissant with mayo for lunch    Please BB    Upgrade your sandwich meats  Clean the tables  Try the soup before you serve it to customers   I really did want to like you ',\n 'I could be wrong but I think there was fruit in my sushi  This is just a Chinese buffet  Nothing is fresh and it was      They have a little make your own station where they grill it for you but mine tasted like they hadn t cleaned the grill very well and it was burned  I wouldn t eat here  Austin has a lot of great restaurants that     and can get a lot higher quality food  Yummi is a little further but a lot better ',\n 'Food was amazingly fresh  recommend the hake and pear toffee cake   Great service  very attentive waitress and water glasses always filed  even had free coat check  Great ambiance for first date to impress ',\n 'Very fun place  Obsessed with the chips and queso sauce  it s basically fried corn tortillas with a pita like texture seasoned with red powder dorito like seasoning  I also got the Shia labeef taco and the green meanie  They are small but packed with a lot of meat and goodness  I also love the tiny dinosaurs you get with the drinks  I got a cucumber gin and it was strong but very delicious and refreshing  Great place to hangout with friends and bring out of town guests  Can t wait to go back and try other drinks and foods ',\n 'One of the food court stalls at h mart  I ve tried both the ramen and sushi here  and would recommend you choose the former  The ramen is pretty decent   not too rich or fancy  but still enjoyable on a cold winter day  I ve tried the tan tan and spicy miso ramens  and they were both decent   I wouldn t recommend the sushi though   I went for the sashimi bento box     ish after tax and tip  pictured  and the tuna was rock solid frozen  Like   hurt your teeth cold  They do give you a good amount of fish as well as a fried mashed potato roll and goyza  but I really didn t enjoy the semi frozen fish  At this price point this really shouldn t be an issue   Anyway  go for a quick ramen if you re at h mart ',\n 'This has become a staple in our last stop check points when out on the town  The Tunnel is very small up top but expands when you go down stairs  This is a typical blue collar dive bar and I like it when I am already drunk  but not so much when I m not  We always stick with the cheap beer which we like most about this place  and their fries basket is good as well  nice portions    So if your already feeling nice and toasty but your not quite ready to go home swing on down to Shanghai Tunnel ',\n 'Not fond of the changes at Frank  It seems like they ve changed their bun to a sort of buttery  sweet  spongy  fat bun that I just personally do not find appealing   And they changed the slaw on the slawdog to a very finely minced  SWEET slaw  as opposed to the crunchy horseradishy slaw I used to love so much   With the loss of my beloved slawdog  I pretty much don t come in anymore    ',\n 'I simply love Five Guys  it s a heart stopping addiction  Their food is so amazing  and the use of real potatoes for fries feels like the home cooking my mom used to do  I load mine up with all kinds of goodies  and just dive in   I love walking through the door to the reds  and the friendly welcome  and it s worth it to wait as they make it completely fresh   This is one of the best burgers in Atlanta to me ',\n 'The Commodore has stolen my heart     Seeing the eminently entertaining  Leon Bridges  show made me realize I have yet to review this venue   If you want to go early and stand you can belly up to the stage and use it as a coaster until the show begins   Anywhere provides a good view  and excellent acoustics    There is an upper level with tables and chairs and these can be found on the sides of the stage level as well   Drinks are a bit pricey but are good   Splurge for  tall   or choose from a variety of brews    I love the layout and it is one of my favorite places to see shows in Canada   One of my friends saw Lady Gaga here   The next time Gaga visited she played GM Place  so it is a great place to get up close and personal with acts that may move onto less intimate venues   There multitudinous eating choices close by   I have yet to eat on site   Vancouver has fabulous music appreciation   My heartstrings were strummed by everyone dancing their hearts out   playing nice this week   I was dehydrated and moved to the outside towards the end of the show   Someone fetched water for me and then I happily joined a dancing group of people I had never before met   Commodore   Great Space   Quality Sound   Good Times',\n 'This goodwill is hit or miss  Sometimes it s really picked over but sometimes you can find great old things  They don t have the best jewelry selection and you can FORGET about electronics all together  Their electronics department is a joke  The clothing is mostly black church lady vintage type style but I love that style so I like the selection  The staff is really chill  They do a good job of keeping the store clean and with customer service  But they are kinda slow sometimes with opening the fitting rooms  The sales for     off for all tags that are a specific color  they choose one color each week at the top of the week  is really cool  Especially because some things in Goodwill can be kind of pricey  I ve seen pants in there for     which is a bit ridiculous for a theist store if you ask me  Goodwill is definitely the priciest of thrift stores in this area but I DO like it here  The parking is decent and it s in a good location across from Soul Vegetarian ',\n 'Holy Smokes  Rachel is A mazing  I have had many massages from upscale Salons Spa s in Portland she blows them all out of the water   My pain has been so severe and achy the last couple days  and she made it feel      better   She uses the hot stones and aromatherapy for every massage  Her prices were very reasonable especially since the hot stones and the aromatherapy were included   I felt like her     years experience definitely made a difference   The location is very relaxing and elegant   I am definitely coming back  Would make a great gift for Christmas or any holiday   I know what I will be giving my friends and family this year  WOW ',\n 'Excellent filling breakfast  The crisped home fries were perfect  The eggs cooked very well  Old school cooking done well  The staff is still working in  There was not anything wrong but a more professional approach in clothing and optics would go a long way ',\n 'Ate here after a game at Fenway   As close as it gets to great NYC pizza ',\n 'First off  I do not like malls   I get overwhelmed and quite anxious at all the commotion and hollering kiosk sales people   But  putting my personal feelings aside and focusing on the purpose of the mall  this is a good one     Polaris has all the high end necessities any clothing and accessory addicted woman could want  Saks  Von Maur  Coach  Bare Escentuals  L occitane  Strasburg Children  etc   Don t be fooled  it is still a mall   Among the pretty  lovely smelling stores are the kiosks   The kiosks  my goodness   I understand that the people working them are doing what they were instructed to do   What I mean is viciously persuading every single passerby to smell  touch or listen to the products they have   If you don t  you will simple be incomplete   or your girlfriend will break up with you   You want a happy girlfriend  don t you    an actual question I overheard and I pretending to be in a deep conversation with my friend      Other than the kiosks vulchers  Polaris is well designed and well maintained   The Germain  I think  valet is a nice touch  never used  but a good to know option   The recently added outdoor section is a creative way to open the walls   It s a work in progress  that I think will enhance business in the warmer months   I would recommend checking out the website for store sales before the excursion to Route      Polaris Parkway  ',\n 'I m sure this place is great  but had a bad first experience  Walked in on a Friday morning and was asked to move to a  waiting area  while tables opened up  There might have only been    tables in the entire place  but wasn t a problem since we came at a good time  would otherwise suggest making reservations     The gentleman who took our order seemed flustered and was a little bit rude  Once we were seated  he came in       minute increments  which was a little bit frusturating  I wanted a particular item on the menu and told me   no  you need to try  some other Moroccan dish    which was terrible    I d really like to give this place another chance  but may wait for a while    Hope this helps ',\n 'The food preparation is a great show in itself and the chefs are really fun   This place is kind of pricey  but really great for group gatherings  The food is all high grade  but whoever said the egg yolk sauce was great should probably get their taste buds checked   I m a very open minded eater  I read reviews saying that I  must try the egg yolk sauce  It s the best   Needless to say  it almost ruined my meal  It has the consistency of lard and is overly salted  I say give it a shot  but get it on the side  and be ready to hit the bathroom about   mins later   Overall  it was a good group experience and everything was really good  minus the egg yolk sauce  ',\n 'This used to be a great papa Ginos  now the service is terribly slow and they often get he orders incorrect ',\n 'I have been to this place at least   times since I ve been at BU  The burgers are phenomenal  the wings are delicious  and the fries are good  I love the food here  It s got that comfort feeling that you just need in the middle of the night when you re cold and looking for something to warm up your soul   The staff here is very sweet  some of the sweetest people I ve run into in Boston  They work fast and efficiently  and the restaurant itself has such a nice and quiet ambiance  I love visiting because it s such a neat little place   I would definitely give this place a try ',\n 'We were looking over the menu and I noticed a tween aged boy swipping across his plate with his finger and liking the food off   Gustavo in Waltham is a MUST try   The textures  flavors and freshness of the food was a party in our mouths  After our meal it took all my might not to swipe away at my own plate ',\n 'I ate my fair share of Lucky Buddha freshman year  Maybe that lets me appreciate Tin Drum a little more  Having seen a couple Yelp reviews about their Panang Curry  I decided to try it out  I thought it was a solid dish  with nice flavor  I think I m more of a noodles guy because I remember really liking the Pad Woon Sen I got the first time I came here  My friend got the Basil Fried Rice  which was a good dish as well  I think I have something against getting fried rice because it is something I can easily make well in large quantities  I would ve tried a Thai Basil Roll  but my friend suggested a pit stop at Marble Slab Creamery on the way back  Who am I to deny a fellow man his ice cream  especially when Tim Drum s prices leave me with enough to splurge on dessert ',\n 'We had to cancel a trip with this company because their service was as bad as I ve ever encountered   Seating charts online were inaccurate  billing was wrong  customer service was rude   We had to contest their charges    successfully    with our credit card company   Do not use these people ',\n 'The place is very unassuming  counter service and take out  The owner was fantastic and great about vegan vegetarian healthy options  I got the Garlic Tofu with the tofu steamed not fried and added vegetables  a     order  which was ginormous  I also ordered the sesame noodles appetizer  which was also large  The food was tasty  really nice  The hubby got General Tso s Chicken  which he said was good but a bit spicy for his palate  he s a lightweight that way   If we lived on the NW side we d probably make this our go to takeout place  So far probably the best Chinese I ve found in Columbus  although nothing really comes close to the stuff I grew up on in NY  ',\n 'Great BBQ  awesome drinks and a really nice patio area  Really  there isn t much more someone could want in a Portland restaurant  It s a hidden gem surrounded by all the construction going on  but it s worth visiting for sure ',\n 'I never take the time to write reviews because I always feel like no one will care  but this visit deserved a review   We live very close to Max and Dylan s  so we were excited to try it  There wasn t a sole in the place when we walked in for lunch on a Saturday  We were immediately greeted and sat in a booth  which was great  The server was slow to come by  but when he finally did my husband ordered a mojito  His mojito arrived and the mint leaves were rotten   visibly rotten  He managed a bar for a long time  but you didn t need his expertise to see the gross leaves  When the server finally came back  we asked for a new one and he knew right away why  They made a new one and it was clear the new ones were new  Not sure why a bartender would use old leaves in the first place    We ordered our food and while we were waiting I looked down to my left below the window and saw a disgusting mess of old food  crumbs  wrappers  etc  It was revolting and I wanted to walk out right then and there  We should have   The food was bland  boring and a total disappointment for the price  The lack of cleanliness around the booths got me looking around more and i started seeing the mass of dust on the light fixtures  the uncleanly bathrooms  chairs at the tables  etc  Revolting   We will never visit a Max and Dylan s again  I can t believe this place is still open ',\n 'This place was so awesome     Let me start from the beginning  So my friend and I made a reservation to eat here after running the Wine and Dine Half Marathon  We had two other friends who wanted to join us so we got to the restaurant    mins early from our reservation time to see if they could accommodate our friends  and they did  While we were waiting to be seated there was a nice young lady handing out small cups of popcorn  Appreciated that  we were starving  After our name was called  we were sent to an outside drive in  well the illusion of a drive in  Many cars in front of a big screen showing old school clips of movies and cartoons  There are   rows in a car that can fit   people in each row  I thought it was so cool the car setting  Loved it  The food and shakes in my opinion were absolutely delicious  I ordered an Oreo shake and for my meal I ordered a cheeseburger with fries  The burger to me was pretty big  The fries were perfectly seasoned with what seemed like paprika chili powder salt  If you love burgers and shakes and want to try out this awesome experience you have to check this place out when you re in Hollywood Studios ',\n 'Never going back there again  First time there and what a disappointment  When we first went it seemed like such a great place for your dog to be boarded at  Our dog stayed there over Labor Day weekend  She was healthy and happy as can be before going  We picked her up on Tuesday  Everything seemed fine  They told us that they just gave her a bath   Which we thought was suspicious   We brought our dog home and then they worst began  She was vomiting and having diarrhea all day  We thought is was a quick little thing from nerves but it s obviously not  It is now Thursday which is three days of this going on  She must have caught something from another dog there  Which means it must be very dirty back where they board the dogs  It s coasted us so much money to fix our dog that they caused to feel this way  We will never put our dog through such a terrible place again  We will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS PLACE AGIAN  For what happened to my dog I don t recommend anyone to board there dogs there ',\n 'Great place to socialize for networking and to just connect with mature adults  On the weekend the DJ is always good and it s not too loud where you can t hold a conversation without yelling and screaming into each other s ear   The bartenders are really good and making cocktails and they are always on point  They have very nice plush seating all around and you can find an intimate spot in a corner or a lively spot by the bar   Named for the antiheroine of The Royal Tenenbaums  this cross between a restaurant and lounge in Midtown s The Four Seasons offers farm sourced bar snacks and shareable plates from Ford Fry and signature cocktails from a marble bar  plush sofas and blue leather booths make for a very sexy grown and sexy vibe   This is a must try if you re in the Midtown area ',\n 'Pretty good  Tried a few of the subs but not the pizza   Big complaint  It was before a concert at the garden and some douchebag was going around the whole place to people in line and table to table trying to sell bootleg t shirts  And he didn t get kicked out  I have zero tolerance for getting solicited while I m hanging out trying to eat in peace ',\n 'I live at River Oaks  and have really loved living here  so much that we renewed our lease  The apartment itself is spacious with big bedrooms  and while it s an old property  everything has been remodeled just right while still keeping the old school charm   There are cons though  The air condition heating is a two pipe system and we experienced a relatively hot winter with only access to heating  I understand the system isn t easily switched  but there would be full weeks in the   s with no AC  Weather is unpredictable  especially here in Texas but maybe there could be a smaller window of time that heat it on  I know that even when it was cold enough for heating  temps in the   s and lower    there were very few days that we even turned it on  Second  there are hookups  but there is not in unit laundry  We have a facility on site  but access isn t controlled and we have had bums going through our laundry and hiding out there at times  Maybe we could put a lock on it  Finally  our seemingly new stainless steel fridge has no ice maker    explain that  HOWEVER  these things were greatly outweighed by the pros  The apartments are new  clean  and up to date  The pool and grill areas are great  They ve added new tables and lounge chairs  The complex is clean and well kept  Maintenance requests are performed in a timely manner and I ve never had a dispute with the management company  A little upset our rent went up for next year and there was no deal for renewing our lease    but we re still close enough to walk to campus  rent is still lower  and the apartment is still bigger than any mega prefab complex you d find in West Campus    Overall very happy   J E D  River Oaks',\n 'One of the poorest dining experiences I have encountered  Our table was totally forgotten by our server  When we asked for our check it was as if we had inconvenienced the staff members  After we divided our check up and triple checked the math  some spent more than others   the server insisted we  did the math wrong  and split it evenly because that was easier for them  even though we specifically asked them not to  It was a busy evening but there is a much nicer way to treat people especially when customer service is part of the job  Will not be returning to this establishment ',\n 'Great dealership and awesome salespeople  Marissa was amazing and extremely helpful  They have tons of bikes to choose from all at great prices ',\n 'Nice sized slices  Get a free soda during happy hour   I ve been to the window many times  at different times of the day  Service is fast and usually with a smile  Decent selection  and quality ingredients  You should stop reading and go now ',\n 'Hidden jewel of Indian quick food  chipotle of Indian food      Quality     Service     Taste     Price     Value for Money      Heard about this place from a frnd of mine looking for non typical Indian food    and gave it a try in our Orlando vacation  It s chipotle of Indian food  We came for dinner and kept coming back     kids loved it    Best for me  everything especially      Garlic Naan Tikka Masala with Goat  Chicken   Panner Mango Lassi Rasmalai       I couldn t stop myself from eating marathon            and Indian beer   ',\n 'Delicious Pho in Austin  You bet  Ended up here on a whim since the line at Ramen Tatsu ya was way out the door  We weren t disappointed  Both starters   pot stickers and the fried chicken   were good though I d recommend the fried chicken  delicious  hot  crispy  and big  For entrees  the noodles in the Pad Kee Mao were particularly good and toppings were generous  though the dish was a little oily  though not  too  oily   The pho  Broth was flavorful and hearty  not watery   with plenty of noodles  beef and veggies  To top things off  service is very friendly ',\n 'I thought City Central was great to deal with  Our agent was very down to earth but also professional  Searching from out of state  our agent made it as easy as possible for us to get everything done in a short period of time  I plan on using this agent again if we decide to move next year ',\n 'I ve had terrible customer service at this store on several occasions   I ordered a car seat and was told that it would absolutely be in the store within   weeks  It has now been   weeks and I am still waiting    Every time I call to ask when they think it will arrive  I get the same answer     any day now    When asked for more specific information or even if I could get a tracking number to check for myself they were unable to provide that info   Also  I registered at the store for my baby shower   I got a voice message the other day telling me that  someone  had purchased a gift for me that they had set aside at the store    When I asked them who the gift was from they had no record of it so were unable to tell me   They checked the credit card slip and could only tell me it was  bought from someone in the US    This has resulted in a highly embarrassing situation of me doing detective work to find out who it is from so that I am able to send a thank you card   Very frustrating   Would NOT recommend this store   very disorganized  uniformed and unhelpful staff ',\n 'I really wanted to eat here    but the hostess was so rude     Years working as a host from casual to fine dining has proven to me that the host is a reflection of the service you will receive      From her hoodie to her eye rolling I just could not  I get it  it s busy  but you should know how to interact with the public  I don t care how popular of a place it is    Maybe I will stop in again on a better night ',\n 'professional  friendly service and a clean  white carpet  wouldn t hesitate to call again ',\n 'Met up with the owner  Very friendly  Selection will vary from time to time  Has reasonable prices  Bought a Honda cb   f       Haven t ridden in a few years  and the owner was very patient with me helping me figure out what to get  Will definitely consider buying from again ',\n 'We went here on a whim on a Sunday evening and boy were we in for a treat  Everything was lovely  It s always special when the manager stops by the table before the meal begins  We had the tenderloin special which came topped with crab and a butter sauce  Super yummy  And the cauliflower side was some of the best cauliflower we have had  We will definitely come again for a special meal ',\n 'Elena was absolutely amazing  I purchased my bridal gown for my wedding in March      at La Reine  which was also an excellent experience  never felt rushed  they really listened to what I was looking for in a gown  and each dress they brought in got closer and closer to what I was describing until we found  the one     They referred me to Elena  and every fitting was excellent  She was timely  kind  and explained everything in detail  My excitement about my gown I think clouded my judgement on my first fitting  and when it came time for the second  I became very unhappy with how the bust looked fit  This was not a result of Elena s alterations  but rather  how the dress looked on me once it fit properly  In the sample gown  and the gown ordered in my size  it was always much too big  Once taken in and fit properly  it revealed more than I wanted  and was an odd shape  Elena took my nervous freaking out bride phone calls in stride  and helped to come up with solutions  We ended up taking lace from straps I had her remove from the gown  and line the bust line for a scalloped look  She also beared with me as I hemmed and hawed over cups no cups  and even made custom cups that I felt fit better out of materials I brought in  In the end  my dress was more than I even imagined  and was almost like a custom gown  Elena saved the day and was so kind  calm  and genuine through the whole experience  Also  my bustle for my extremely long train was gorgeous  and I am one of the only bride s I know  whose bustle lasted the entire evening  I recommend her highly ',\n 'I really like this Salon  I ve been several times  and I think they make a big effort at making you feel like a customer in the true sense of the word  I give them an A  on the  extras   mini facial  shoulder rub  no tipping  It completely sets them apart from other places   However  I would only recommend Sam for a haircut  I ve gone to Corey twice and the second time the cut was so uneven and bad I had to have someone else fix it  And during the haircut she said   Who s the best haircutter   I wanted to laugh  but instead I just didn t answer  It was highly unprofessional and immature    On a better note  Sam is extremely professional  nice  and fabulous at what she does  Corey should pay attention to her and try to emulate ',\n 'Always love this place  Friendly people  Amazing food  They deal with my pickiness  Love their warm chips and salsa  Yummy  Love it  Big portions ',\n 'I m trying to figure out what happened from the time I started going there in July      to the day in July      I decided that the salon had gone seriously downhill  I think perhaps the popularity of the place has overwhelmed the management and staff    When first started going there  I drank the Kool Aid  The stylists are very knowledgable about black hair and I went to one of the styling workshops  which was very rah rah    I like the hair products when they are actually available  but they seem to have supply problems  For example  I think in the year I went there  I was able to buy the recommended hair glaze once  And even then I pre paid for it and had to wait on a list for it to come in about three weeks later  I ve not seen it stocked since  The same goes for the hair mousse  which it turns out is likely just repackaged Design Essentials brand in a Synergi bottle  I do love the shampoo and conditioner  though   As for the stylists  I m not going to name names because it seems like a general problem  Okay  let s get real  for natural hair  they re really not doing anything high tech  I did see some cute styles walk out of there  but for what I had done  shampoo  trim  twists   nothing special  For that reason  I changed stylists at one point to see someone who was available for my schedule  And guess what  My initial stylist totally BLANKED me when I came in after that  I was  like  seriously  This ain t some NYC salon  But  then  when I came in to buy product  the second stylist blanked me as well  I m willing to go with they just didn t hear me say hello  but whatever    The final straw of me not coming back was  like Rachael  waiting    minutes for an appointment  getting shunted off to a junior stylist because they d overbooked the senior stylist  and it taking me     hours instead of the usual one to get out of there    Okay  I lied  the final final straw was that  and this may have changed  when I first started going there  you could only make an appointment online and only pay with a credit or debit card  TWICE after using my card there  weird unauthorized charges popped up and I had to get new cards  I have no proof that this was Synergi s faulty  but if you check their internet security info in the address bar  the site s not verified nor encrypted meaning sending your credit card info via their site leaves your precious info ass out in the world for fraudsters and identity thieves  The penultimate time I went  I noticed a woman paying cash  so I did the same the last time I bought product    If  after all this advise  you still decide to go  use a prepaid card with the exact amount of your services on it so you don t get jacked ',\n 'Nice staff and the grounds are kept very nice and tidy but the apartments are horrible   We lived in an upgraded two bedroom apartment and loved it when we initially toured the apartment   When trying to move items in we realized there was NO storage in the apartment   Small stack able washer dryer that would fit only a few bath towels at a time and the windows are SO thin you can hear the traffic from    th all day long   At night semi trucks would drive by and shake the whole apartment     The parking at this apartment complex isn t good either   Unless you have a carport don t plan to leave your house after  pm or you ll be parked in the neighborhood next door ',\n 'It ok here   I had Thai food because the Hawaiian place I came here to try was already closed very early in the evening    I thought the whole point was to have lots of choices if you cans with a group    The Thai was good but this place is nothing special    It could be a lot better organized ',\n 'Very fast and friendly service  The team is knowledgeable and keeps you informed step by step during the repair ',\n 'Yelp  this was a very crazy situation  I have nothing bad to say about the way the realtor treated me and my friends  at least at first  She was nice and friendly and went to the same college that we went to  And then things got worse   We sent in an application  deposit and signed the lease on this place that she basically said we had  She said our credit looked good and we were going to get it  That was yesterday   Today  she called me roommate and said the land lord had already rented the place and she didn t know  Honestly  checking that the apartment is rentable should be the first step a realtor makes  The rental process is infuriating enough without having to deal with these extra issues ',\n 'Buyer beware of buying a car from these a holes  If you do you better get everything in writing   They will give you a whole bunch of promises on things they will fix on your used car u want to purchase but when u pick up the car nothing will be done  The car won t even be detailed like they say they will   The vehicle I purchased had pretty badly damaged hub caps  They told me they would replace the hubcaps  Guess what when I went to picked up the car they replaced one     They said they only promised to replace one       really    I told them hubcaps is plural not singular  Then  since I didn t spend enough money with them they treated the detail and cleaning when u buy a car like a big middle finger  Don t buy from there ',\n 'These guys are the best   We used to take our Havanese downtown for grooming and decided to give Doggy Amour a try  Not only is the staff beyond friendly  they give our

injections  I have been going to her for over   years and would not trust anyone else with my face  The spa overall has a nice vibe  staff is very friendly  and I look forward to trying more of their services ',\n 'This place pumps out the best circular pastries in the area  Great bakery that is worth going out of your way to visit  The line is usually long  but to the employees credit   the line moved quickly  Their coffee was good and strong  but gets overshadowed by their doughnut game  Try it now ',\n 'Food was so so  have had much better  Service was slow  in an almost empty buffet restaurant  Dont order a Ceasar ',\n 'Love this restaurant  Best oyster selection in town  Outstanding service  Great Bart selection ',\n 'This is the first time I have ever been in a JC Penny outside of a major mall  The store had some excellent deals  mainly due to the holidays  All of the staff that I encountered were extremely friendly and helpful  I m happy that this location is not too far from my residence  My wife and I were able to pick up some clothes and toys for ourselves and to gift to others at really great prices  This will definitely not be my last time coming ',\n 'Shea is unbelievably talented  I ve had so many massages  and they are usually always enjoyable  but shea is on a whole other level  She finds the perfect pressure for you so that she s making progress on

 Effing slow  Don t even deal with the redhead with glasses  She serves in order of skin tone  Love that they serve beer  Food is decent but takes forever ',\n 'Delicious  authentic  best tacos I ve ever had  Their sauces are all homemade and fresh    I can t forget the homemade salsa with avocado chunks ',\n 'Horrible experience  I opened a loan for major dental work   I send my payments thru my bank s bill payer which had been set up to arrive on mu due date but because of their incredibally slow internal processing tit was  late    When I spoke to them they waived the charge but now I have to send my payment    days early just to allow for their procssing   They added a     fee which I didn t know about so my payment was not the  full  amount   I received no less than    phone calls about this      fee even after I told them I would pay it under protest    They are obnoxious and are constantly trying to add on fees    Find another bank   I wish I had read Yelp before I made this decision ',\n 'Went to AutoNation   was greeted by Steve Mcllhon  I have to admit  the guy has lot of patience given the fact that I am very picky about cars  He ended up showing me lot of Interior

ripoff     Even though this pizza has declined year after year  my wife and I live in the area and like walking to go out to eat so we made a reservation one night and we showed up on time    Before we walked in we joked how even if you are on time there  they always ask if you can go to the bar and have a drink while they get the table ready   Of course this is what happened despite there being   or   tables ready for seating but I guess they figure they can get an extra drink out of you doing it this way   Then after you order the drink  they come by     minutes later and tell you your table is ready   The one next to us was available also   This went to the people that walked into the bar right before we left to head to the table   What a racket   You can imagine we were in a great mood at this point     The people that seat you also try and give off this attitude that we are lucky to be dining there or something   They don t realize that this place stopped being hip     years and people with no taste or no clue make up     of their customers   The other     are dummies like us probably hoping it has gotten better but really just rolling the dice again        The attitude and making us get a drink at the bar part wouldn t be  a big deal     if that pizza was good    but it wasn t       at all     I have had frozen pizza better then this   The ingredients have obvioulsy gotten cheaper and I have heard that they have gone through a number of pizzaiolas here  one went to Antico  but whoever they hired needs to keep it in the oven a little longer   We ate half the pizza each and brought home what we didn t eat and it tasted better reheated  and fully cooked I guess  but still not worth the     each that we paid for these     I would recommend Antico pizza near GA tech or if you want a little more ambiance since Antico is VERY casual  like eating in an Italian ktichen still cool  then I would go to Baroanda on Peachtree near the Fox   I have been going there for    years and they still do a great job    Both serve the Neapolitan style small personal pizzas way better then Fritti   I wouldn t recommend Varsano s at all   Their pizza is not good despite the owner Jeff Varasno s big mouth stating it is   But this review is about Fritti       I am an Italian American from NYC and have been to Italy   times including eating pizza at Pizzeria Trianon in Naples  da Ciro on Via P  Colletta if you ever make it there    My wife and I saw it on one of Mario Batali s Food networks shows many years ago and checked it out   Still the best pizza we have ever had   If you think you might like clam pizza check out Lombardis in NYC or Pepes in New Haven  CT   Frank Pepe invented Clam Pizza      Don t go to Fritti   You are better off ordering a pie at Fellinis on Ponce or Johnny s on Cheshire bridge and picking up a good bottle of red from Greens or Ansley Wine Merchants ',\n 'Great Chinese restaurant  My friends suggested this place for many times but we never got a chance to visit there cuz it s about   miles away from where we live  They said go ask for authentic Chinese menu and order the Napa Meatball soup  OMG we love it so much  We also like the Szechuan pork and garlic veggies  The prices are great too ',\n 'I was really disappointed this week when I ordered a large tortilla soup and half chicken salad   When I got back to my office and opened my containers  I felt ripped off   The salad which was close to    contained no lettuce at all  and only smidgens of veggies  plus a few pieces of really nasty tasting  dry chicken   The tortilla soup was basically a creamy gooey blob with no texture and no spice   All this for       I think not   Despite the fact that this place is convenient to where I work  I won t be going back ',\n 'Really great vape shop  They have a wide selection  and a very knowledgeable  helpful  and friendly staff  There are a couple of shops closer to me but I always go here because their selection is bigger than most and the staff is so warm and welcoming  Great atmosphere and great prices too ',\n 'Stopped here for a quick dinner before a show at the Orpheum Theater  The buttery and delicious lobster roll and extra cold lobster tail  half tail for     was excellent  They also sell local Maine sodas and Cape Cod chips  The service is fast and efficient  This stop was our first time here but I would definitely come back the next time I m in Downtown Crossing ',\n 'Almost   stars  Food was delicious with great flavor   Sweet potato gnocchi was our favorite  pesto was so good   And we loved the peas and mushrooms that accompanied the dish   The side sauce with the calamari style mushrooms was too sweet for me   Sushi salad was good  and the added tempeh crab cake was outstanding   I wish I had added      I didn t notice Kombucha on the menu until we had already finished our meal   bummer   Outdoor seating is west facing and on the warm side in the evening   Indoors seemed pretty warm too   Hostess had a really weird manner about her   Everyone else was lovely    I wish they had some fermented foods on their menu  and whole grain bread instead of the white ',\n 'Uh mazing  I like savory and sweet  The Corned Beef Hash breakfast is fresh corned beef  shredded  not cubed  The hash is Redskin  peeled  and yams  onions   light peppers  It s so fantastic  To satisfy my sweet  you can substitute any  for the toast that comes with it  I chose  ricotta blueberry pancake  No syrup needed  This is simply delicious   I m a raving fan and will be back ',\n 'Customer service is great  Every year I got some discount   I hope it ll be a good service if I submit a claim',\n 'This is a small little place with good burgers  I ve been here a number of times for special Birthday dinners and it s been a blast each time  I personally am not a fan of their chips  but they have plenty of other options ',\n 'Had the worst experience of customer service  Am moving to a different location They would not cancel my registration They had a bond for   months  my mistake  i did not read this in the fine print Was not aware of it  I even showed my tickets  but they denied and wanted more proof  I had never met to a more unfriendly  rude person with no intention to help us before   Harassment before  days of your move   would be an underestimated phrase to say about what we went through Yet they did not cancel our registration  Truly disappointed    Its a place which would milk out your money and take advantage of your situation',\n 'I needed a quick meal while I was on campus  so I ran to this place   It was fairly quick service     I was going to try the basil fried rice that everyone has been yelping about  but  I was feeling noodley   Usually I am weary of these asian fusion places  but I went with pad thai because it s usually sufficient most places that serve it   I got it with tofu  it tasted fine   Not great  not microwaved either   I also got the thai iced tea   it was also just okay   So why did I give this mediocre business a   star   Because all I ve eaten in the past    hrs was this dish  and it made my tummy  quite  upset   I will probably never get to try that basil fried rice now ',\n 'I would trade the atrocious waits for some of the other popular Greek places in the lower mainland for Sfinaki any day  I always get seated immediately

kids and the food was pretty good  The tortillas are VERY good  Tuesday taco night is       for   tacos rice and beans ',\n 'Decent restaurant   We got the appetizer tasting plus some baby octopus ceviche  I saw that on the menu and immediately wanted it    Nothing really popped at the appetizer tasting with the fried goat cheese  dumplings  duck pop rocks pate and the calamari  The calamari was decent  pate was fine  goat cheese was not very good and the dumplings were just good dumplings  Kind of regretted getting the whole thing    The baby octopus ceviche wasn t really too good  it wasn t exactly like a ceviche  It was like some cooked baby octopi on top of some fresh salsa  Not bad but not what I expect you know     For entrees we got the fried chicken with lobster Mac and cheese  the scallop and shrimp Siam stir fry and the New Zealand rack of lamb  The fried chicken was really good with the lobster Mac and cheese and the fried chicken was very juicy and yummy  So far the best fried chicken I ve had  But I m going to jct kitchen tomorrow so we will see about that  My boyfriends    year old cousin from Alabama loved this dish  This was probably the second best thing   The Siam stir fry that my boyfriend got was not very good    He said it tasted like Americanized Chinese food with better seafood  We wanted something more spicy and authentic tasting    My rack of lamb was really good  well cooked  I wish they were more meaty but the dish came together nicely in terms of flavor    The thing that sets this to a   rather than a   is their toasted pound cake  It was just so good  Crispy on the outside and soft inside  warm with caramelly bananas on top with some perfect peach ice cream  God this thing was great  Our guest the    year old said it was the best thing she ever ate and that she would drive all the way up to Atlanta for it if she could  Lol  Best thing of the night    I would come back but only for the toasted pound cake and the fried chicken ',\n 'God  I miss Arlington s restaurants    This place has great food  I had flank stank for under      and it was probably the best steak for that price  I ve ever had    Chimichurri sauce rocks

to catch your favorite games   They recently revamped the menu   The food is reasonably price and what I would expect from a sports bar in terms of quality   I highly recommend the pizza   I m headed back on Monday night to watch the Bears game ',\n 'My boyfriend and I ordered pickup last night through the Yelp app which goes through a company called EatStreet  Once we received the e mail confirmation that our order went through  we walked just   minutes down the street to pick up the food and we were planning on eating outside as it was a lovely evening  When we said the name on our order  they couldn t find it  They actually told us they never even received our order  even though we showed them the order confirmation that was e mailed to us  They then proceeded to tell us that they never even heard of EatStreet  We said how could that even be possible  It made no sense  Anyways  while we were trying to figure out everything  we asked if they could place the order for us since we were starving  They said sure  but that we would have to pay again  So when we finally got our food  we called the number for EatStreet  They looked up our order and told us that Golden Temple just signed up for EatStreet and they they called to confirm the order and sent a fax and received a confirmation from employee s at Golden Temple  They were nice enough to remove the charge  so we only paid once  Food was ok but giving   stars for the hassle ',\n 'The vibe at this place is amazing  Great live music  overall great atmosphere  The service on the other hand was a   star at most  the hostess was great  My wife and I ordered the cornbread as a starter  We didn t get the cornbread until about an hour and a half later with our meal and to add to that  the cornbread was cold I immediately asked to replace the cold cornbread with some fresh ones took about an additional    mins for that to come out  I ordered the Jerk chicken and waffles  The waffles were amazing  but the jerk chicken was burnt and not the  good  burnt  it was the type of burnt that left a horrible after taste in your mouth  Our waiter wasn t very attentive at all  didn t seem like a busy night  overall it took about an hour and    mins to get our food once we were seated  Overall the place is nice  drinks are great atmosphere is vibey  Just hope that you get a good waiter or waitress  Hopefully the experience will be better next time ',\n 'Overrated   If you re from South Bay  Voodoo is essentially the same as Psycho Donuts in Campbell  I had their Captain Crunch donut  and we also got their bacon and maple bar  and a few glazed ones  They have super sugar ified donuts with overly done designs that are sure to pack tons of overwired energy in them    Service was on the grumpy side  but hey   y all have lines out the door all the time  so what s to complain about the money you re making  Each donut was about     and lines move quickly  This is definitely a tourist trap  but if you ve never been to a crazy donut shop  then this is your stop  It s just not for me   I would rather eat at Blue Star  another Portland donut place  because it seems more edible and unique in terms of flavor ',\n 'Tried the Korean fried chicken and the street corn are delicious  Our server  Anthony  was super friendly and made some great recommendations  The drinks are what you d expect from Inman Park price wise  The menu also notes vegetarian options ',\n 'Great service and quality breakfast food  Huevos rancheros were impeccable and the blueberry pancakes just perfect  The juices

could not be more pleased with the service and quality of food  My guests were very impressed  The buffet luncheon included pinwheel sandwiches  a mediterranean platter  potato salad  pesto salad  roasted veggies  coconut chicken  and much more  I would highly recommend Pemberton s catering ',\n 'Let s be real here  The Perry s signature Pork chop is the way to go here  They carve it table side as they tell you how to eat it  It s huge  so share it or be prepared to take it home  We love perry s for special occasions and for what we call  fancy dining   it s great to have a family date night  and they are good for kids too  You can get the chop on sunday s w a salad and a desert trio  the Spinach bacon salad is one of the best things i ve ever had in my life  not joking ',\n 'Today was my first time at Anthony s Roast Beef   Got a super roast beef   way and small oinon ring   The roast beef was medium rare cooked perfectly just the way I like with just the right amount of sauce mayo and cheese   The oinon rings were really tasty you could definately homemade   There were too many oinon rings I couldn t finish them all   Overall great experience I will be coming back soon ',\n 'We went to Tony C s at Fenway last Saturday to enjoy the roofdeck before going to the Red Sox game  The view and atmosphere are great  The beer and apps were so good  All the waitstaff was quick and friendly  The Manager Steve is the best  He made sure we had everything we needed  He has awesome customer service  Will definitely go back soon   Derek',\n 'This Starbucks is huge  It was also incredibly busy when we went there  The line wrapped around the store  They were really good at moving people through as fast as possible  but still it was really long   So overall there s nothing wrong with this Starbucks  it s also doesn t stand out among Starbucks locations ',\n 'Both Dr  LeClairs  father and daughter practice  are extremely friendly  gentle  and patient to cater to my husband and my own fears and dental needs   My husband is deathly afraid of the dentist  and Dr  LeClair took the time to make him comfortable  gave him some headphones to listen to music and even watch tv while he had procedures done  They have state of the art technology there with individual screens tvs at each chair  so you can either watch what they are doing on the screen or watch tv to distract yourself     We have been going there for many years now and after many root canals  fillings  and cleanings  we couldn t be happier with the service we get   Their office is very modern and Dr  LeClair always remembers us and what is going on in our lives   They are a very sweet an down to earth family   I HIGHLY recommend both Dr  LeClairs ',\n 'The food was really tasty and fresh  Four stars because the restaurant itself is so tiny that it s more of a to go spot than an eat in restaurant ',\n 'After buying our first house  my wife found BK Home Improvement on Yelp as we were searching for a company to repair some siding  replace basement windows and remove some old insulation  I was skeptical at first but after talking to Bill  he quickly earned our trust and respect with his responsiveness and can do attitude  and the website and recent positive reviews on Yelp     Bill s estimate was very fair and prompt  so we went with Bill  and the positive Yelp reviews turned out to be true  It was easy to communicate with Bill  and he checked with us about new window availability and preference    Bill had a friendly and professional team with Mike and Marie  and they got the job done in one day  Bill also replaced a damaged flood light bulb and helped me find the right color paint without me asking  I also like to try to get involved hands on during the project  asking questions  helping with the clean up and lending a hand where I can  and Bill was cool with that    Based on my first home project  I would say BK Home Improvements is a reliable company to do business with  I feel lucky to have met them  thanks to my wife   and we are very satisfied with the results  Looking forward to our next project  kitchen counter and some cabinet modifications  ',\n 'About a      mile from the Old North Church is Paul Revere s house that he lived in during the Revolution   It is SMALL   It was hard to believe that Paul and his wife housed   of    kids total in that place at any given time   That aside  the tour staff at the site are real pros   Much like the folks at the Old North Church  they know their history and are very patient with the tourists   Everyone we encountered could not have been nicer ',\n 'Ok  so maybe I expect more because I am a bartender  However yesterday  after a union work seminar I went to One   Sportgrill   Bar  I was the ONLY person waiting at the bar  I made eye contact with someone I assumed was the barback cutting lemons at the far end of the bar  I nodded to him and he continued to cut lemons  After two full minutes a manager walked behind the lemon cutter  noticed me and elbowed him  He shook his head then slowly walked my way and asked what I wanted  It was the bartender  Seriously  I was floored by his lack of interest in serving a paying and tipping patron ',\n 'The best neighborhood gathering place  Very casual attire  good people and great food  Everything from breakfast to dinner is great  The best is you can add proteins and such to base plates so you can eat healthy or throw on some bacon  I eat here several times a week  Also  the staff rock   I always feel at home ',\n 'Great food and nice restaurant and first time I been their got Scottish Eggs sausagae ball great and second time I got was pizza was great too  Service is great and friendily staff but the Chairs on theo were uncomfortable and that s only complaint I have about your restaurant and everything else is perfect ',\n 'This is a before and after picture of my   year olds hair   The Blo team worked their magic and it came out beautiful   I couldn t be happier   They always treat her like a princess when she goes and it is a very special occasion for her   She has even asked if we could have her birthday party there  My wife also goes there and has never had a bad experience and her hair is always beautiful afterwards   We couldn t be happier with the team at Blo and thank you for everything you do   ',\n 'Mikaela is so worth the trip to JCPennys  She was so personable and knowledgeable  She didn t try to sell me products I didn t need  She listened to me and tailored the products to my needs   She also waxed my brows into the shape they were meant to be  She walked me through each step and gave me a plan to take home  She is amazing and I highly recommend her ',\n 'While the food was half decent  the staff was completely rude  We sat down and not once did a waiter waitress come to our table to ask if we needed anything   We had to go to the bartender to ask for water  When I mentioned this to the female owner  she didn t care to hear my complaint and never once apologized  Needless to say  I will NEVER go back to this dump ',\n 'From the outside  it doesn t seem that Hobo s would promise much  Located in the heart of Portland s Old Town Chinatown  a neighborhood rife with real life transients and homeless people  even the name of the establishment strikes an ironic chord   Once inside however  the friendly staff and cozy atmosphere make Hobo s a welcome oasis in a wasteland of nightclubs and dive bars   Happy hour runs from              which gives you plenty of time to order sliders  wings or tacos from the menu   The bartenders are attentive and competent  but this isn t really the place for a craft cocktail   Stick with the classics and you ll be just fine  Don t be afraid to sit towards the back  near the large gas fireplace   It s the perfect place to warm up on a chilly Portland night ',\n 'One day we will have Uber in Vancouver and we can finally be rid of rude taxi drivers  no shows  and bad service  Anger the public enough and things will change ',\n 'I love Dr Ong  He s the greatest  I m not going to lie  I hate people touching my teeth     however I enjoy going only becuase they are so great at what they do  I had my molars pulled and did not feel a thing  I almost had a panic attack and was crying even before the dentist did anything  yes I m    and I was crying    But he assured me it would be ok  and was able to do it quickly and with no pain ',\n 'Celebrating a birthday promotion life  This is a great place to do that  Food was phenomenal  I opted for the romaine Caesar salad and had the house special pasta  linguine in a tomato based cream sauce with mussels and shrimp   Both were delicious  Service was great too  One tip  make a reservation  This place gets packed and for good reason ',\n 'We had done our research and came to see a car we thought was priced well for the amount of mileage and the year it was  The pictures on the internet gave it no justice  Our salesman  Peterson Vasconcelos  came out and greeted us as soon as we got out of our car  Since we already knew what we were looking for  he quickly grabbed the keys and showed us the car  It was super clean  very luxurious  and in great condition  We then test drove it and fell in love with the car  Peterson also let us see some other cars which we liked  but could not purchase due to us needing a specific car for employment reasons  Throughout our time there  everyone was so courteous  helpful  and friendly  The process took a little long  but Peterson went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and even provided us with lunch  The manager came and introduced himself which is not something that normally happens at dealerships  Axel  who handled our financial process  did everything he could to make sure we had all our paperwork in order and made the process quick and smooth  When it s time for us to purchase another vehicle  we will definitely consider Orange Buick ',\n 'Yummmmmmm    This place is quaint and amazing  They have so many yummy baked goods and savory dishes to choose from ',\n 'Wish this place could get a good manager and return to its former quality  The food is usually still very good  though not as consistent as it once was  This is the only reason we continue to go there  always hoping management will have improved  Hibachi and sushi dishes are very good  kitchen Chinese food is often excellent  when they get the orders right  Sometimes the tables and decor seem to need a good cleaning   floor is sticky or slick  tables a little sticky  They rarely seem to have enough servers  Manager is incompetent at running a restaurant   unable to manage honor simple reservations  unable to competently handle a kitchen mishap to fix the situation for the customer  unable to staff and train sufficiently  Takeout more often than not forgets to include something or gets the order wrong  As I write this I wonder why we still go there and I suppose the reason is that there isn t any better Chinese food in the area  We have tried them all  Where in north Orlando can you get real fried rice   not just seasoned rice   anyone know  Business opportunity for a great  NY style Chinese restaurant in north Orlando now that Imperial seems to have lost its quality ',\n 'My husband and I stayed here last night the bed was comfortable and the room was clean  But when I turned on the TV it just gave me blue screen and was in Spanish  I called the front desk and Maureen  the nightshift desk assistant came to the room  figured out the previous occupants unplugged some cable so fixed it for me   The next morning she was still there when I went in to l grab a quick bite at the Continental breakfast   Maureen was still there and with who I believe was her manager they were both very nice and said goodbye when we left   It was a nice stay   Thank You ',\n 'Food and drinks were great  The sauces had great creativity and added layers to each dish that I covet  We came on a Monday night which is half off wine night and awesome value on their best vino  We sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table and the male bartender was awesome  We had a little interaction with the blonde female bartender and even from a distance it was evident that you should steer clear of her  She was very controlling and overly suggestive  clearly someone that needs to be in control  yet has no business being in charge  Overall  great experience and I highly recommend ',\n 'This place is ridiculous  Clearly all of these reviews here are prior to their new staff  I know they re new because they all stand there yelling at each other about what to do and how to do it  I came on a day where their were three others ahead of me  No big deal  Except one of the workers just stood there  one stood at the register  and one made all the sandwiches alone  When people walked in they d yell at you to say they only had white bread  The man in front of me was Asian and did not speak English so he was pointing at things he wanted  Apparently to these workers the proper response was to yell at him  Because you know yelling at people that don t speak english suddenly makes them understand you   Finally the other girl just standing there starts making sandwiches  She put two slices of bacon on my BLT  I told her it s four  Her response to this was  well how the fuck do you know   I said that two years ago I managed a subway for a year  The bread was horrible it was crumbling apart everywhere  It took   minutes per sandwich for everyone  And I swear to god the entire time these three girls just stood there yelling at customers in between running to the back to grab random food because they hadn t prepped any   What a joke ',\n 'Porter square is a convenient little shopping plaza   It has a    hour grocery store     hour CVS  hardware home goods store and a few decent places to eat ',\n 'Mio Sushi has always been a dependable location for a high quality  reasonably priced lunch   I ve only been here for dinner once  but if my memory serves  the menu is the same for both lunch and dinner   The sushi is always very fresh and tasty  although for my particular taste buds  I don t find too many of the rolls to have my favorite combinations of ingredients   I m not a fan of cream cheese in sushi rolls  for example  but a number of Mio s rolls are creamy smooth with dairy goodness   I know this appeals to many people  but I d rather enjoy the subtle nuances of the fish and vegetables balancing against the rice   On my most recent visit I tried the beef ramen soup  which was flavorful and chock full of noodles and veggies   The service has always been extremely friendly on every visit  but there is one issue I should comment on   for some strange reason  on EVERY visit to Mio Sushi  I have had my sushi order messed up   Either an item gets left off accidentally  or they double up on something I didn t ask for  or there is a mystery item brought to the table   The servers are always exceptionally polite in correcting these minor items  and half of the time I don t even mention it   but it is puzzling to me that I have so consistently had my orders scrambled   especially since they read back the selections before taking the menu order card back to the kitchen prep area to confirm what I ve selected   Ah well  there are worse crises in life   The restaurant is clean and tiny  and I have never had to wait long for a table   There is a small parking lot on the north side of the building  access from Greeley Avenue   but it s always full every time I go   I love this place and will keep coming back    even if the ordering process isn t always the smoothest ',\n 'The service is good and the food is decent  I guess I always want the food to be a little bit better than it is  for the price   Certainly worth a visit considering the lack of Cambodian food in the area  but perhaps I have failed to order their best dish ',\n 'This is my absolute favorite store in Austin   It s my first stop for gifts  and they have the most fantastic clothing  jewelry    skirts    stuff you would never find anywhere else   Sometimes I also have sudden cravings for Retablos  Dia de los Muertos stuff and Milagros   and it s hard to get outta that store without really spending time   wanting to buy several items  You REALLY get to indulge your passion for folk art  mysticism   fair trade clothing items at Tesoro s   and you can t beat the location on SoCo ',\n 'Whoaaaaaa     we need these in Minneapolis  Really need these    Torchy s is this little trailer plopped next to a cool bar with  misters  that whips up a mean taco for no more than        My bean  cheese  chorizo  and green chili taco was   bucks   can you believe it  I would have paid    And I should have ordered    They were out of eggs  which was a disappointment to some  but at midnight  I just wanted some good ole grease  so it didn t bug me none    They also have this Fried Avocado thing that I didn t try  I was a little put off by the idea of a cooked avocado   but a table mate raved about it  I ll give it a go next time    Torchy s  you are my new BFF ',\n 'Tried the Burnt tip pork belly tacos and the burger  All I have to say is wow     delicious   I ll be back for sure ',\n 'A short bus ride to Bybee  Heh  I wasn t excited about the bus drive but from work it was only like    minutes   Bus    let me off right next to Saburo s   I show up and I put my name on the list and my date shows up just as our table becomes ready which was only like a    minute wait   This small place was packed  I mean jam packed  People were still lining up and signing up   OK   I had expected that from previous friends remarks   OK  I was warned that the servings were gargantuan   Yes they were   We ordered flying fish roe w a quail egg   i could be wrong about what kind of egg   eel  yellow tail  tuna  and the largest salmon skin roll I ve ever seen   This salmon skin roll was bigger than my hand   Also the salmon skin roll was so delicious  not salty but smokey and sweet   I would go stand in line again just for that   The waitress forgot about the refill on our water like we asked but besides that everything was perfect   Looking around too was just amazing   Giant plates with giant portions  it was very American but with chopsticks   Although these portions are so large it s hard to stuff a whole piece in your mouth    I ll be back again and again ',\n 'GREEDY MONEY HUNGRY COMPANY   I have been renting my home since       pre Internet  I ve been with HomeAway since       It used to be an advertising platform but has become terrible booking site  No longer can I speak with guests pre booking and on top of my yearly subscription fee  guests must pay a service fee  This is in addition to the credit card fee I must pay  HomeAway has taken the power away from the homeowner  Now I received notice that they will charge me a     fee if a guest inquired through their site but books through another site    I ve had the same people inquire through HomeAway and Airbnb  How can they image that this is ok     So disgusted with them   Will not be renewing ',\n 'I ve been wanting to try this place for a while  especially as this is an IG foodie favourite in Vancouver  My friend and I got the  Little Charlie  and the French Brioche  that comes with fried chicken  The portions are not for the faint of heart aka they are huge portions  The Little Charlie was my fave amongst the two  filling and satisfyingly good    Service was great and the place has a cool decor and vibe inside  Definitely want to go back and stuff myself with the red velvet pancakes next time ',\n 'Wonderful frozen yogurt with a self serve topping bar  I wish I lived closer and I d be here constantly  They have excellent coffee selection and great looking baked goods  I just wish they opened earlier so I could make it my morning coffee place  Highly recommend it ',\n 'I always have great experiences visiting Dr  Levin s office  He greets with a big smile and gives me his time and attention  unlike my previous experiences with other doctors where they can t get me out of the office fast enough  I am getting IPL laser treatments done for my facial acne scars with him and before we started he told me that his number one concern is that I am happy with the result and reassured me that he will work with me until we achieve that  He always makes sure I am comfortable and informed  I have also been in for other dermatological issues and Dr  Levin is very attentive and comes up with a plan to address all issues  He is an extremely personable  passionate and experienced doctor  I would recommend him to anyone ',\n 'My husband and I just tried this place this week it is in walking distance to our home  we were not disappointed   The menu is simple and hip  the prices extremely reasonable and a great jukebox   They also had a great rose wine for under    a glass   We will definitely be returning ',\n 'Not the best pizza in the world  but a hot n ready pizza for    is a pretty good price   It s actually cheaper than the ones you find in the frozen food aisles of the supermarkets   I still think Red Baron   Digiorno are better pizzas  but if you don t want to put anything in the oven and want something quick this place does it cheap ',\n 'A great place to nibble and drink  Excellent beer list  Music on Fridays   An array of mules and cocktails  Flat bread a little flat  Lots of TVs  Try the Lemon drop cocktail good ',\n 'I had an appointment this weekend with David Boggins at American Crow tattoo and I couldn t be more pleased with either the service or my tattoo    When I found David s stuff online  I was incredibly impressed with his work  especially the detail he manages to put into every piece  I live about three hours away from Columbus but I knew I would be willing to make a trip for the right artist  David was definitely the right artist   I sent him an email with a link to a Pinterest inspiration board I had made  The American Crow website encourages you to do this when you email them  which was a great idea  I explained to him what I was looking for  set up an appointment  gave them a down payment and settled in for an anxious wait  Possibly because my consultation was over email  I didn t see a sketch until the day of  Depending on how much control you need  you might have to ask David for progress pictures or for email updates  For me though  I was perfectly fine with being surprised    As for the shop itself  I immediately felt like I had walked into the right place  Animal skulls on the wall  antique furniture  rich colors and the Beatles playing on the radio  It was like I d walked into my dream living room  The lady manning the front desk was very  very nice and I m bummed I didn t catch her name  Because this was my first big tattoo and I had just spent three hours in a car thinking about what was to come  I was VERY frazzled  I mean  she asked me who my appointment was with and my mind just went blank  She was very patient with me and very kind   David showed me the sketch and asked my opinion on a few things and we were ready to go  He has a tv and a computer in his space for putting on movies which was a great distraction  We watched the Royal Tenenbaums after discovering a shared appreciation for Wes Anderson movies  Like the woman up front  David was very kind and patient with me  I was very interested in the process and spent a lot of time hovering over him and taking pictures  His  bedside manner   so to speak  was excellent  We chatted about this and that but I never felt either pressured to keep up conversation or like I was distracting him with my ramblings    The tattoo itself is beautiful  It s everything I could have hoped for  American Crow went above and beyond and I can not thank them enough ',\n 'I ve got a problem  I haven t stopped thinking about the pork chop I had a week ago at Perry s  It really was one of the best pieces of meat I ve ever had  and it s haunting me    I had never heard of Perry s Steakhouse before my meal  except that it was new  Turns out there s one in Houston    This restaurant is expensive   have no doubts about that  But the food was outstanding  Outstanding I say  Au gratin potatoes were good  I had a bite of my wife s filet  which was very good  Lighting was nice    Our waiter was attentive and professional  The only problem we had with him was with desert  We ordered a dessert that supposedly took    minutes   It took    minutes    and when I asked about it  our waiter told me that it takes longer because even though he put the order in  the kitchen might take longer  Boo  Lame   He really should have told us about the desert either at the very beginning of the meal  or at the first hint of someone being finished with their meal  Not after the table was cleared  coffees were ordered and delivered  etc etc  Again  except for this    the waiter was great    So  except for this one faux paux   the meal  and the evening  was excellent  I highly recommend ',\n 'Yummy hot chocolate  Even though it was a sunny  warm day in portland I couldn t pass up going in and having a cup    and neither should you ',\n 'Great ambience   service is ok depending who waits on you   desserts are wonderful   but biggest complaint is that coffee hot chocolate  etc is lukewarm   I was told they cant reheat   disappointed  ',\n 'Having been blessed to eat at many truly great restaurants  in the US and abroad  I can say with great confidence that our experience at Gunshow was one of the best meals EVER  Incredible food  each dish better than the last one if that is possible  Incredibly comfortable environment  phenomenal service  very high end quality meal  but not at all pretentious  Great cocktails and well as wine and beer choices  The people are as amazing as the food  I have eaten at two restaurants rated in the  World Top     and I would put Gunshow equal to or above them ',\n 'Very flavorful Indian food according to this white girl  My Indian counterpart found it to be a westernized experience  We had the ruby trout and the vegetable kofta which I thought were both delicious  However the naan and rice were somewhat disappointing  The naan was made of more white flour than is traditionally used and the rice was not basmati  The wait was about   hours  We went exploring around the neighborhood and returned  They have fairly attentive bar service in the waiting area and they also pass around tasty appetizers  We really enjoyed the chips  papri chaat  and pakora  I had the ruby cocktail   but it was disappointing and not flavorful  Worth another visit but not a   hour wait ',\n 'Everytime I ve gone in  with or without an appointment  I ve been seen in a reasonable amount of time  The decor is nice  and the staff is always very friendly  The facilities are very clean and comfortable   I have gone to Suely for brazilians and eyebrows  It was my first brazilian ever  and I was terrified  She made me feel very comfortable  both by explaining what she was doing and by distracting me from the pain  She did a fantastic job  so I ve been going back ever since ',\n 'A month before I mustered up the courage to try Strenghtfit  I recieved bad news about my health  At    years old  my cholesterol was triple what it should be  I wore     waist pants  and I couldn t walk up stairs without becoming winded  Something had to change  I tried going to the regular gym  but really didn t have a plan  nor did I know what I was doing  After a month an a half of jumping on the machines  I felt like I needed something more  I heard about crossift a few years prior  but always thought that it would kill me  My heart can t possibly keep up  blah  blah  blah    I did my research and found that workouts can be scaled for any fitness level  Then I decided to give it a go  I found Strengthfit on Yelp and really liked the testimonials  One in particular seemed so close to my situation  Joseph T    so I tried it  My first day was tough  Good tough though  I had so much pride over what I had just done  It seemed inconcievable that I could do that    So  after   months  here are my results   I fit into a     pant waiste  I just completed a Crossfit competition  I ve lost over    pounds  then gained about       pounds of muscle  and I feel amazing   Here is my advice  just try it  Don t worry about your fitness level  Coach Christian will make it work regardless of where you are at physically  You won t die  unless you continue to ignore your health   You will never feel better both physically and mentally    Oh  and everyone at the gym is awesome  There is NO judgement  only encouragement ',\n 'I have been going here for years

The room layout was a little small for the room I had   Where they have you put your suitcase was almost too much in the walk way     This Crowne also had the Keurig machine for the coffee  and they included bottled water for it at no extra charge   They had   different types of coffee tea to chose from   Big TV mounted to the wall  HD Flat Screen  only problem is  you can t turn it   Sitting at the desk you can t get a full view of the TV     High Speed internet wasn t too bad  Speedtest showed a           Not super fast  but you could still watch videos and download files     I had room service one day  Club Sandwich with Fries  and it was huge   Tasted really good   I couldn t finish the sandwich until later that evening     Parking is Valet or Self Park  both of which cost you money   Not a big parking lot  but I didn t have a problem finding somewhere to park ',\n 'I feel like this place is a little overrated ',\n 'I used to love this place but has been steadily going down

last time there were only   people in the theater and the manager wouldn t let me go in  The owner feels that it would disturb the viewers  I am someone who has been to many a movie with people coming in late and they never disrupt my time at a movie theater   As a mom who looks forward to having time away from the responsibilities of being a mom for just   hours once a week  I really look forward to going to The Alamo  They need to do away with the late no entrance rule  With things changing in Austin with the seating and now this I guess I thought they would try to stay the old Austin ',\n 'The hype is real  I had the blackened crawfish po boy with a side of corn and it was DELISH  Such great flavors and the portion was huge  I shared and was still full  There is a bar next door where

only complaint was that one of the buttons on the coat already came off    within hours  And another is already starting to go  Bleh    Other time I went  I got a shirt for      Still in good shape  still wear it  months later   Employees didn t seem super jubilant or chatty or anything  but I think I preferred that anyway ',\n 'Totally a tourist trap  but worth the stop in on a Saturday afternoon   I was really impressed with how big this place actually is   I know a lot of the radio stations throw their Christmas parties here  so I assumed there was a sort of function room  but the whole place is just big     of course there is a comedy club section   a full line of touristy type whatnots you can purchase so that your trip to Kowloon will forever be remembered   The decor was pretty original for an Asian restaurant   though the flowing water was a bit distracting   I liked how there were large groups  they put out this lazy Susan type thing so you can just spin it to pass food    how ingenius     small groups like my cousin   me  but I didn t feel like it was too loud or that our waiter paid any less attention to me   The afternoon specials are decent    tons of food for very affordable prices   I think I got crab rangoon  veggie lo mein  chicken fingers    a spring roll for like      Their drinks are good for your typical Chinese place drinks    strong as hell   served in fun glasses   My biggest complaint about this place is the small bathroom   The place seems large enough  but there were only   stalls crammed into a small area   As if that was not bad enough  I could pretty much see myself while I peed   Odd   There is this film over glass which on the outside looks like a mirror   then there is a mirror outside the stall right across from it   The film on the glass allows you to see directly  out   So say  if some random stranger was standing outside your stall  you could see them whilst you peed   Ick ',\n 'Joey s was my top Thai place in Somerville  since I work in Davis Square and live in Porter  I was just in there a week ago chatting with the sweet girl behind the counter  who is in law school while her parents run the restaurant   But tonight I go by for a late night order  and to my shock and horror  there s a note thanking their customers for   years of service  NO  THEY RE CLOSED  I m sadder than sad about this  I don t know why they re closed and don t know where I ll get Thai food from in Davis Square  Big big sigh ',\n 'I went and bought a jeep at quirk jeep but had a horrible experience  I figured I would try Kelly Jeep Chrysler for the repairs  it took   weeks to get an appointment   I dropped it of at     am  and got a call at     pm to pick up my jeep  They fixed two problems in the jeep  one they said is normal for the patriot   I am starting to have the same problem that they already fixed but I m waiting until the snow has come and gone before going in again   I hope I didn t buy another lemon or I m in trouble ',\n 'I just started working downtown again and I decided to check out this Food Hall   I originally intended to go to another vendor but Aiko caught my eye and i wasn t disappointed   The Spicy Poke was the special of the day and I ordered it with veggies   It was the perfect amount of food and I also enjoyed the free refill on my Hapa drink   This will be a regular lunch spot for me ',\n 'They came out within   hours of my call  and had my broken springs replaced in under an hour  Very knowledgeable and friendly  Thanks  As far as price goes  they charged less than the other   places that I called ',\n 'They know what to do with my feet  I have a big short toe that feels really uncomfortable if too much dry skin grows on the side  Everytime I leave Bebe spa  they feet ways feel refreshed  They re also really nice about me not being able to make up my mind with the colors  a d doibg last minute add ons ',\n 'I m     single and childless  yet I love this toy store  Wow  that sounded sad     It has some fun doodahs  cute little critters and lots of Sanrio stuff  Really wide variety  I used to love going as a little kid  Now I go to pick up gifts for kids AND adults ',\n 'It s cool that this place is so conspicuously positioned on High Street and features a lot of upstart local bands as well as some of the more well established Columbus musicians  The vibe is relaxed and the bar itself is a good place to sit and talk to people  The barkeeps have always been friendly on the handful of occasions I ve visited  And there are pool tables  Years ago  before i ever set foot in there  i thought the S G was a sports bar or a predominantly jock hangout  The good news is that it s quite a bit more diverse than that and really is one of the better choices for a night out of scouting some music ',\n 'Ok  so I am updating my review  Within the first couple of minutes in the establishment  we noticed an instant difference  They now have a hostess  which makes greeting you and sitting down easier and quicker  They were also very attentive and quick  Our first time here  our biggest complaint was the service  This time we were asked  constantly if everything was ok  Las time we also experienced errors in our orders    Not this tome though     No errors with our food and service was incredibly fast  The change was so huge  that I decided to tell our waiter that we were incredibly happy and amazed by the change in quality of service   The waiter was happy that we had let them know and the owner came to speak with us directly  She also wanted to hear our feedback and let us know that they really care for reviews and had read my review  among others and had decided to continue making changes in order to make the customers happier  Well  my friends    This place deserved a second chance and we can t wait to go back  We were also told that on Wednesdays they have bottomless sangrias and live latin jazz     By the way  we had the stuffed french toast with guava and cream cheese and it was amazing  Also  we had toast which was very memorable since they use adobo and latin spices  Boyfriend had bottomless mimosas and loved both the mango and guava mimosas  Will be coming back soon ',\n 'I came here with some friends for my birthday   We had a reservation and was seated right as we entered   The staff are extremely nice and attentive  Our waiter was awesome as well as other staff   We had two kids with us and both had some food allergies and they were attentive to make sure the food did contain the allergen   They would always ask us if the kids were eating certain items just to make sure  We ordered two Tomahawk steaks   one medium and other medium rare   Also the pork chop   The tomahawk steak was delicious  One of the best steaks I ever had  The flavor of the outside was awesome   It wasnt too dry or too bloody   It was perfect   The pork chop was delicious as well and the sauce with it is amazing   We also ordered raw cherry clams and ravioli as appetizers  The clams were a bit disappointing as the size were super small   The raviloi was not bad   Overall a nice atmosphere  I d definitely go back ',\n 'Excellent late night pizza  and typically a range of interesting vegan and meat options  Recently they had some mushroom pizza which was outstanding   Their crust is thin and good  though not as bubbly and crunchy as SFNY s  Love the Hawaiian when they have it  On late weekend nights  the more you indulge  the better the pizza tastes   Often it s hard to get seating if you go at peak hours  so be prepared to stand and eat your pizza looking out a window  or walk and eat while perusing Powell s across the street ',\n 'We recently participated at a family wedding at the Boston Public Library  The space was beautiful  especially the courtyard where the ceremony was held  the BPL event staffers were great and paid close attention to detail  and the reception and dinner after the wedding  catered by the company that BPL uses exclusively  was terrific  Everything went off without a hitch  Even the weather  mostly  cooperated    Thank you  BPL ',\n 'I was driving near Mass Ave and one of my window glass wouldn t roll back up  probably something in the assembly broke  It was a cold day in single digit  drove over to JN phillips and requested help  A gentleman explained that it will be a longer job than a quick fix since they were completely booked for the day but he was kidn enough to fix the window with a temporary solution and I was back on the road  Did not charge me anything though he worked on it for atleast    minutes in the cold weather  Thank you very much     I will have to check if they can work on the panel itself since the glass itself is fine ',\n 'An experience like no other  We got to Lucy s at      and asked for a spot in the shade  The incompetent hostess then gave a us a seat  with a lake front view  However  she doesn t seem to understand what  shade  means  Lucy s features high end solar Windows screens that increase the temperature of the restaurant by   °  It was    outside and at least     inside  After almost dying of heat stroke  we asked to move tables  The hostess we spoke to had a deer in the headlight look and said that we were  inside  so it should be cold  Let me take a second to define what inside is according to Lucy s  an enclosed garage with no air conditioning  solar radiation panels to increase the temperature   x   tables that are a piece of shit and are about to fall apart    However  there were moments of relief  The direct path to the sun over lake Travis would get blocked by massive hordes of newborn flies  One feature of Lucy s is that they are a fly breeding farm  Every    minutes  a new colony of flies is born  which swarm the restaurant and cause an eclipse with the sun    MUST HAVES FOR LUCYS    cans of off    bottles of water  you won t get refills  Hazardous materials suit     fly swatters Immunity to malaria  The flies were terrible  But don t worry  not dead flies go to waste  Rumor has it they put the flies into the chicken boudin    We ordered an appetizer and some chicken  After    min the appetizer came and was just a bunch of vegetables on ice  We waited another    minutes   with no refills or waiter interaction   and finally left    The science experiment at Lucy s is truly one to see  The hordes of insects that the fly farm produces is amazing  and truly an experience  The lack of human interaction really makes you feel like you are isolated on a hot  fly infested island with no signs of food to eat except for flies        would eat again ',\n 'I brought my dog in here recently after a bout of bloody vomit   diarrhea  I feel like I ve been taken for a very expensive ride to diagnose and treat the problem   We brought a fecal sample with us to our first visit and began going through the list of tests the doctor wanted to do  without first getting the results of the fecal   He wanted to do comprehensive blood tests  pancreas  giardia etc  to arrive at a diagnosis  My wife and I expressed our concern for the financial impact of doing all of this at once  and stressed that we d like to do the tests one at a time in order to save time   money  So after hearing that the fecal came back with little or no bacteria in it  we went ahead and did all of the tests the doctor recommended    hours later we re standing at the check out with no real answers  Ok  fair enough  The bill was so big that it made mathematical sense to go ahead and get one of the wellness plans to get as much out of our money as possible  Honestly  there was some confusion there  as the front desk girl seemed a little off on her explanation of the financial breakdown of said plan   If you re not familiar with Banfield  they basically set their prices for visits   testing very high so that when you face your bill for the day  it seems like a better option to go with one of their wellness plans and get the next years  visits as well as a few tests included    Fast forward another   days  and my dog is still having the same problem  We went back with another fecal sample  convinced that they overlooked the first one and sure enough  they diagnosed her with a bacterial problem and sent us home with antibiotics  Also it s a point to mention that the initial doctor I saw was unavailable for the entire week  so it s up to me to properly relate the story events to a completely new Vet who is unfamiliar with my dog and her problem    In the end  my dog has had this particular bacteria at least three other times in her life and I ve never spent so much time and money to arrive at diagnosis   treatment of the condition  typically I bring in a fecal  spend around       dollars and go home with antibiotics that cure her over the course of a day or two   Banfield charged me hundreds more  took up more of my time  and in the end when I related this experience to management and staff  we received no compensation sympathy for the way things went down  all we got was a runaround and more wasted phone time  I will be cancelling my wellness plan and won t be going back  Avoid this place unless you don t mind throwing away time and money  Banfield is corporate America through and through ',\n 'I ve been going to Gordon Automotive for years and always receive excellent and prompt service  The staff is helpful and knowledgeable  Highly recommend ',\n 'I agree with everyone s post about it not being the most attractive place to go  but the services and prices are great  Think about it as a  hole in the wall  for beauty services  May not be a pretty place to go  but the product is great    stars if they just spiffened and renovated ',\n 'A burrito can be a fantastic meal     apparantly not the case here  Chips and salas are good  and even the nachos that came with barely any chips  one thin layer of chips with cheese  chili  and whatever toppings you choose     That s okay though  cuz you can just get more chips       It was when my burrito came out    I was amazed they would call such a thing a burrito  I chose chicken and cheese and beans   minus the beans  and they weren t kidding  it was the smallest burrito i ve ever seen with a few pieces of chicken and cheese  it was bone dry and next to it sat a pethetic excuse for a salad i think  it was a few cubes of tomatoes on top of a small handful of iceberg lettuce  no joke  worst burrito in my life  no rice or no salsa on the inside    mybe I got confused with the menu  not sure  Either way  it still didn t taste good ',\n 'Mmmmmmm so good  There are no Ethiopian restaurants near where we live in north Texas so  we pretty much only get the opportunity for it when we go back to Uganda  Addis is as good as it gets  We ordered Gored Gored  Tibs and Shiro Wot to share between four of us and it was more than sufficient  I usually go for the Tibs but I think Gored Gored is my new favorite due to its spiciness   My first time to try it  If you don t care for a little heat  you may steer clear of it   I ve never seen beets or corn served wth the veg portion at any of the other Ethiopian restaurants I ve been to but  everything was fabulous  It was our friends  first time trying Ethiopian and they loved it   Not surprising   We will definitely be going back next time we re in Columbus and our friends who live here now have a new favorite restaurant   Bursting with traditional flavor  friendly attentive staff and surprisingly quick  we loved it ',\n 'I see that my original review has  disappeared    Well let me tell you something  It has been six months now and I am still suffering horrendous breakage   I was there for over six hours     she actually called a friend to bring over three bottles of wine and ordered me to  start drinking  which should have been my first clue   When she was drying my hair I could see the broken pieces of hair floating around my face   I asked her what the heck was going on    She said it was NORMAL   I know better than that  I walked out without the haircut and she begged me not to sue her because she said she didn t have  anything  worth suing for   I have had to be very patient with the hair loss at the back of my hair    I have new empathy for men experiencing hair loss and having to do comb overs   It was awful awful awful   My new salon told me that I was the second worst case they had ever seen    the only one worse was a lady who gave herself a home perm and broke all her hair off      I had a really bad feeling when I walked in and I should have walked right out but I was feeling too embarrassed   She left to take one of her many smoking breaks and I got up to leave since she hadn t started on me yet other than to put me into a chair    and I bolted out to the parking lot   She saw me and hollered at me  where are you going     Are you coming back      II hollered that I had forgot my wallet at the last place I was and I would be back   Okay  I lied  but she was scary and I knew she was whacked   When I got into my car and drove down the road I knew I had dodged a bullet   till I realized I had left my phone there     She had taken it from me to put in her charger when I arrived        I had to go back       Once I got there and she actually got started discussing with me what I wanted I told her I was getting a strange vibe and I wasn t comfortable there   She told me she had mixed up my bleach and I better stay or else she d waste the product   Dang   I should have paid her a few bucks for the bleach in the bowl but instead I stayed and she honestly ruined my hair   I left a play by play review but it has now disappeared   The girl was all over the place   I swear to God I had to order her a pizza because she kept saying her blood sugar was low and that s why she was so dizzy and out of it   I figure I lost about     or my hair   I am serious   I still have not been able to get any corrective coloring because my new stylist is afraid my hair can t take it   RUN FOR THE HILLS ',\n 'Honestly  on the inside there is nothing special about this place  except for their ridiculously high prices  Color selection is limited  there are no special creams or hot wax to dip your hands into that are included in the price  The place is outdated and honestly not the cleanest  So why would I give this place   stars  Because it lasted  My nails pretty much always come out great anywhere I go but they don t last  But these   I don t know what kind of products they use but I got these done OVER   weeks ago  There is no sign that my nails are going to break soon and the color hasn t chipped  Mind you I got acrylics and it s about to be   weeks without a fill  That never happens to me  My acrylics break or have air gaps after   weeks ALWAYS  To some people this might be worth the price  I wasn t planning to get a fill which is why it s been almost   weeks  But if I get a fill so they last another four weeks it might be worth going back to this place  But honestly  I won t be going back here for a full set because the price is just high ',\n 'I get sick to the stomach trying to write this review     STAY AWAY from this place     The worse service I have ever had   Seriously  the only way they could have been worse is if the girl waiting on us spit shined our silverware in front of us  but she would have actually had to bring us some in order for that to happen    Fine bad service  but the food was good   Hell no   The chicken was raw   RAW   I could go on about the details of this experience  but it really just makes me sick   This is a dangerous place and not worth the risk ',\n 'We are from King George  Virginia and we came here for Brunch with our friends before we headed back home  We were greeted with smiles and  how can we help you   We ordered the French toast and the create your own omlet with a crab cake  It tasted as great as it looked  I will definitely be trying the crab cake sandwich the next time I come to Atlanta  I definitely recommed eating here ',\n 'My experience echoes Liz B s   The idea of French Cambodian food sounds so interesting  and several friends had recommended Elephant Walk to us  claiming it was their favorite  I get the impression there are certain dishes that are great  some are OK  and some are just plain bad  I ve gone twice  and each time my partner s dish was much better than my own   Most recent trip I used a Groupon  the only way I could justify giving Elephant Walk a second chance  I really WANT to like them   I ordered  Saiko Cha K dao  Sliced tender beef sautéed in a spicy lemongrass sauce with Ma am basil  julienned cubanelle and jalapeño peppers     mm  sounds great    What I received was not great at all  First off  the presentation was awful  It looked like old leftovers thrown together in a stir fry  The pale dry looking strips of beef next to chunky blanched green bell peppers  mixed in with what I guess were jalapenos but also tasted like bell peppers  The beef was dry and tough  not AT ALL anything resembling  tender   It smelled like old hamburger that you sniff and question before deciding to use or throw out  There was no flavor  i saw a few scattered wilted basil leaves in the green mix  but did not taste it  I did not taste the lemongrass  There was no  sauce   The jalapenos were indistinguishable from green bell peppers  I would be disappointed if I paid    for this meal  yet this costs      I don t know how a chef puts this out of his her kitchen and feels OK with that  I m not a chef and I d be embarrassed to serve guests something like this  I d say  sorry guys  this didn t turn out right  it s going in the trash it s not fit to eat   Let s order a pizza  Yet this is supposed to be a nice restaurant  and they serve this    My partner again  had better luck than me  He ordered the special  some stewed short rib  It was dark  savory  and tender  although the flavor obvious and not really nuanced in any way  It was good  solid  But then this was all thrown off by the rice that came with his meal  The rice was what you would have in your rice cooker if you left it in there for   days straight  It was browned  dry and crunchy on the edges  and dry in the center at best  You know when rice dries out at it goes from white to clear  His rice was     clear  I asked the waitress if this rice was supposed to be prepared  crisped  or in some way we were not aware of  Rather than answering the earnest question  she asked if we wanted a replacement  which I took to mean that no  the rice was not supposed to be dry and crispy  and YES we do want a replacement  After nearly finishing the meal  the steamy  fresh replacement rice came out   really  is that so much to ask for  Rice that hasn t been sitting out so long that it is crunchy and clear    Sorry  Elephant Walk  I really really wanted to like you  I don t know if you ve been through changes since my friends have tried you and loved you  But fool me once shame on you  fool me twice shame on me  I m not coming back for thirds ',\n 'Great  Chinese  food  I think they are from Vietnam   No MSG   Fresh and quickly prepared  They do veggies right   that is if you don t like gelatinous veggies that have been cooked too long  The specials  usually     per day based on the seasonal ingredients  are where it s at    They have all the normal Chinese food that your typical ignorant white person would expect to find  but they really shine with the fresh veggie dishes ',\n 'I love this chiro   I go to the one on Burnet because I love Dr  Snow   Lauren up front rocks too   They are very honest about insurance billing and are

hostess and a few moments with the manager on two separate occasions is enough to know that I will never return or recommend this place   Everything from attitude  taste  and food is below

got Maluken delivered tonight and were sorely disappointed  Our noodles tasted bland if not bitter  the sushi was of poor taste and quality  and the salads had approximately four leaves with a lump of

frustrated  I am a platinum elite member  cant have my room but walk inns have rooms without any reservations  One was even upgraded while I was trying to check in     To a king room suite     You

'Worst food in Disney  The Happy Family Duet entree is terrible  It was stir fried beef that tasted like it had been marinated in salt and shrimp in a red sauce that tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce

is disorganized   chaotic  Not too mention  everyone who works there is really rude  Save yourself the headache   avoid this place at all costs ',\n 'Ordered Take out  First time I think I have seen the standard curry take out container to not be full  about a big inch missing  Red Curry was more watery than I am also used to therefor slightly less rich      is not cheap for less portion and

party was in the gym    True  the food can be hit or miss and the service   okay it s a McM s  which comes with a certain level of indifferent service   But they totally hooked us up for the wedding  brilliant bar service  outstanding pastas and over the top service   Our wedding night was the only night I stayed there and it s safe to say I was in an altered state but I d go stay again in a heartbeat    if the place weren t about   blocks walk from home   We hit the soaking pool and the movies whenever we can   best of all in a snowstorm  when nobody can get around very well in this town

favorites and my regular spot for romantic stuff and birthdays  disappointed me on Valentines Day a bit   Overall I still highly recommend them   Service at Valenties was pretty lack luster   I m not sure how many tables the waiters had to take care of  but it certainly took a long time to be seen  longer to just water brought   I think from the time we were seated until food arrived was close to an hour  we did have an app in between though  but it seemed long   Our reservation was for   or     and it was after    before we ever left   I just didnt feel as warm and fuzzy as I usually do coming here and the waiter didnt seem quite as friendly as the ones in the past   I ll still recommend the place  I ll still come here for Happy Hour stuff  and I ll always enjoy the good food  but for special events  I d certainly recommend boosting staffing a little bit to help out  especially when you have customer dropping close to or over      for two   Had this been my first time here  and I hadn t had better experiences in the past  I would have rated a   probably and it would only be a passing consideration in the future  but fortunately I know better and have had better from Chez Zee ',\n 'This is one of those little Austin secrets  that you want to keep to yourself because you know if the words gets out the place will be crowded ALL the time  However  it s my Yelpsibility to let all the good peeps know of this hidden gem  If you want genuine  authentic Mexican food  this is your joint  It s tiny  so inviting your group fitness class to lunch isn t the greatest idea  The coffee is made like the coffee in Mexico  It s unique   some find it amazing others find it unpleasant  I had a Chilaquile dish with chicken topped with a couple of eggs over easy  It was seasoned exceptionally with a perfect balance of sweet and spicy in the sauce  My girlfriend had a breakfast dish w  potatoes that she didn t even come close to finishing  We ordered chips and salsa before and boy was I thrilled when I saw they had home cooked chips  Perfectly crunchy and mmm so good  Around    bones will get you all of this food including friendly customer service  Our waitress was accommodating and put in a noticeable effort in ensuring we were fully satisfied  They have one TV that ll probably be playing some type of show in espanol  ',\n 'Tuesday evening  February   th

flattened by a hot brick to cook  Flavorful and well prepared  Served over the most yummy and creamy polenta I ve ever had and some onion jam and micro greens which were also very flavorful and fresh

of the other dinners  and to be honest I probably won t because their sub game is just that good ',\n 'Don t let the tiny building deceive you  It looks small from the street but the rave reviews only tell half the story  Poor Calvins is a Midtown favorite   I love the vibe here  The music is a good mix of house music and techno  The furniture is club yet relaxed enough that it isn t up tight  I enjoy the staff as they re always playful and happy to see you    My favorite appetizer is the calamari with wasabi sauce  The calamari is perfectly crispy with not too much breading that you don t taste the squid  The wasabi sauce has the perfect bite to go with the texture of the calamari and the seasoning they garnish both with has to be made with crack  I licked the plate   The pineapple fried rice is to die for  Served in a half a cored out pineapple  the rice is perfectly crunchy with large chunks of veggies and toasted pineapple    The chicken pops are a fun play on traditional chicken wings  I chose the teriyaki dipping sauce and couldn t stop eating them   The crowds flock here on the weekends and happy hour is a full house    Come for the food  Stay for the drinks and beautiful people and keep the sangria flowing ',\n 'My husband and I had such a great experience  The food was amazing and so was the service  It s a hidden gem around here  From margaritas to desert we were pleased ',\n 'The Margherita pizza was awesome and the service was top notch  Special commendation to our hostess  Elisha  who was extremely attentive to our needs  neat   thorough and so very pleasant  We could tell from her aura   her smiling demeanor that she enjoyed taking care of her customers  Our cashier  Amaris  greeted us with a welcome smile and was very courteous   patient with our menu questions  Even the Manager  Matt  connected with his customers   he brought the pizza to our table and made sure we were satisfied with everything  I liked the glass partitions layout around the counter  where you could see the pizza being made from scratch  The taste of this pizza was unique and delicious  We enjoyed our meal immensely and our time with the folks at Red Oven ',\n 'One of my friends owed an arcade and serived japanese curry there  sadly his place closed down  but I still get a craving for curry now and againg  Thanks to Tampopo  I can satify the is craving  One of my favorite spots to go to for chicken cutlet curry  The service is always friendly  and the food is always delicious  Also  try out the crocketts and the octopus balls  Great for a quick meal and small groups  and remember it s cash only   Side note  they have updated their menus and added more delicious items to the mix  Look for the deal of the day  A different dish is on special every day  just find the arrow on the photos  a nerf arrow  ',\n 'On the Christmas Eve   They had fixed course meal   Appetizer  secondly  main and dessert   Food was good   But the service was okay and it took forever that the food was served   I get it that it was a busy night but it took   hours to get the second meal was served   We have  well behaved kids but it was too long for them   We decided to take main and dessert to the hotel   The host was kind of rude too   Again food was great but they kind of ruined our Christmas dinner   Oh top on that  drinks were bad   My Jameson and soda was so weak and Manhattan tasted just Vermouth     It was     Canadian each course ',\n 'Excellent food and service  with warm and inviting decor  Would definitely recommend ',\n 'Chef Robert was great  Best dairy free hamburger I have had in a long time  Chef Robert took his time on a very busy night to make sure this dairy allergy gal could have something delicious to eat for dinner  He even visited us after our meal to check on us  Five star service at Finnegan s in Universal Studios  Our waitress Michele was awesome too ',\n 'Great Food    I was a little embarrassed to find out the original was actually in Chicago but no matter as it allowed me to find this amazing restaurant and have become a frequent dinner here in Chicago ',\n 'Went for a little cab ride with my friend a couple days ago with these guys  Honestly just read the comments before and they ll explain what they re about  Even better yet just download Uber or Lyft  Makes sense only baby boomers use this kind of stuff anymore ',\n 'Given that my husband s favorite food  and mine  is pizza  we usually start our vacations in a different city by sampling the pizza  This pizza was great  Sold by the slice or you can order a specific pie  Thin  crispy and flavorful  Store is clean with fast service  A good variety of vegetarian friendly slices  If we didn t have such a short trip in Portland  we probably would have come back to test more flavors ',\n 'The freshest pizza I have ever eaten  Service was impeccable and the wine list was perfectly matched with the flavors  As an Italian American from Boston  I can honestly say that this was a truly delightful experience and the food rivals anything in the North End  Nice work ',\n 'New Paradise  I ve been in Atlanta over a year now and I ve just discovered you     I must ve passed you a hundred times thinking you were some shady massage parlor  With a name like New Paradise who can blame me  Also  I m not      sure  but I think the Chinese characters say Orgasm   I m not even joking   I ve been here a couple of times now  usually to satisfy my hunger after a night of drinking  I know a lot of people use beef chow fun as a benchmark to judge the restaurant but I m not a big fan of it so I usually get it s saucy cousin  beef with crispy noodles    Beef with Crispy noodles Half Roast Duck  Wonton noodles Salt   Pepper Squid Peking Style Pork Chops  Everything I get here is pretty good  and service is always quick and friendly  I also love that they re open til     am on weekends ',\n 'Extremely unprofessional location  I had bought a    minute facial on Groupon and called to schedule an appointment  I was not greeted appropriately and after bad phone signal was eventually hung up on  when I called back multiple times the voicemail was put on even though it was during business hours  I was finally able to schedule  I arrived on time for my       AM appointment  I filled out paperwork and was taken back to the room by my  esthetician  I was taken aback by the unprofessional wear of the women  she had jeans and a shirt on with Bluetooth around her neck   out of all the facials I have been to  I have never seen an esthetician dressed so casual  I was escorted to the room and was immediately turned off  the room seemed musty and not very sanitary  The facial didn t actually start until       and the women who was doing my facial was going in and out of the room to get the supplies  She was not prepared for my appointment  I was under the steamer for    minutes  only had extractions for about    this was a complete and total waste of my time  I just felt like I was lying in the bed with product on my face and no actual facial going on  I saw the time just wasting away  It was a strange and awful experience  If you re used to a professional setting  this place is not for you ',\n 'I have had issues in the past at this location  but it seems that they have stepped up their game lately   nd order in a row that was exceptional service and accuracy  Please disregard all of the previous low ratings  because this store is really trying to turn it around  Give this Papa Johns location a chance to exceed your expectations ',\n 'What a fantastic happy hour  I was on a trip in Vancouver and I walked the entire Stanley Park only to end up right in front of her just in the nick of time for happy hour  The prices were fantastic and I got a seat outside so I could sleep on my glass of white wine while I slipped down oysters looking at a beautiful view  I also have the guacamole which was really delicious and filling  Between what doesn t oysters and a guacamole it was a pretty satisfying dinner  on top of that the prices were happy hour price of the oysters were       and I think the guacamole was about eight dollars  Either way I felt super fancy and the service was wonderful  I asked the waitress to sit me somewhere where there would be an Outlet so I could charge my phone and she was very happy to accommodate me  The other things on the menu looks really good as I saw them being ordered by people at other tables but I was there to chow down on oysters which were very fresh and delicious  Totally recommend this to anyone especially visitors who take the long walk around Stanley Park and then need a place to sit and enjoy the view for a little while',\n 'I ve been coming here for years and the drive thru soda tastes like they have multiple of flavors  The coke and the dr  Pepper never taste right   a lot of syrup and not a lot of carbonation  Maybe they need to clean their machines  Wilsonville location has it right ',\n 'Go  you will have a good time  It is a formula that has been working for them an awful long time   It is a riddle  The line is a disorganized    minute wait  but many of the tables are empty  A vegetarian could have   sides  but its hard to fine   side items that have no meat  If you have the time and a GPS go to the Oakwood Café in College Park  I had the chicken  with leftovers for lunch the next day  Authentic fried green tomatoes  to be sure ',\n 'Checked out this location  which is better for dining in evening hours and weekends  compared to El Arepazo Latin Grill  which is open only for lunch hours on weekdays   The quality of food is awesome  My companion was happy about his draft beer  international   I had chimichurri carne asada  Prices are the same in both locations  this one has a bigger variety in menu ',\n 'Crab cake bay shrimp Benedict was really good  Eggs perfectly poached  Hollandaise was just the right amount  Pancakes were fluffy and light  Tasty  Sourdough toast was awesome  Accommodated off menu request of Alberts Eggless which was amazing as always ',\n 'Bumping to four stars  seriously amazing margaritas at a pretty bangup price     for a large house marg  and that isn t neve HH   Stick with the Mexican side of the menu  Don t understand the ad for     margaritas   seriously  since when do you promote your most expensive item  Its not a store in beverly hills  Its mexican food in a strip mall ',\n 'We had an incredible experience at our Ultrasound appointment  Our technician Marcy was amazing and she went above and beyond  making sure she got the gender figured out      even though our baby girl was being a little stubborn and not cooperating at first  Marcy was so kind and made sure we felt comfortable and left feeling happy and satisfied I definitely recommend Ultrasona Fetal Fotos to anyone who wants to found out their baby s gender earlier than the typical    week Doc appt  The atmosphere is also very clean  serene  comfortable and welcoming ',\n 'We were staying across the street at the craphole Rosen Shingle Creek and needed a few snack and drink options to keep in our room during our stay  This Publix is huge  very clean  and very well stocked  There was ample parking and the staff was very friendly ',\n 'Mono Ghar is one of the few places boasting a five star rating and they definitely deserve it  As others said  it s located inside the international grocery called Arirang  You enter the grocery and keep going straight while hugging and left side and eventually you ll stumble upon the simple stand with a few barstools  I came here in between class and work so only got takeout but it was great nonetheless  The owners are obviously proud of their cuisine and will happily guide you through their menu  I got the momo johl  waited for impatience for them to prepare it  which doesn t take long   then happily paid and booked it back home to eat it  There were eight momos  dumplings  with a spicy sauce  The sauce wasn t that spicy for me but I always take my interpretation with a grain of salt when explaining to others since my tolerance is very high  Everything about the momos are unique and delicious and it s surprisingly filling as well  The hype for Momo Ghar is      true and if I didn t live so far  I d easily be a regular to this place ',\n 'Never normally a long line  and its an easy quick way of having my oil changed  I have made the mistake of taking their word of needing an engine flush   WORST MISTAKE EVER  After this expensive Flush I ve always had brown particarticles floating in my oil  which they report everytime as now needing another flush  yet according to other mechanics I never needed the flush and having it done only broke up and loosened pieces of debri that will now be forever floating in there  Spoke to other car owners who have never had an engine flush in their entire time owning cars   my fault I suppose for falling for the pressure tactic    Anyway still my go to for a simple oil change  but nothing else including cabin air filter changes which is  x the cost of doing it yourself ',\n 'Very nice and clean updated hotel  I had a great stay for   nights in Jan       for military training in the area  The staff was awesome and bed was comfortable  Did not get a chance to eat breakfast but it looked good  Only negative was that I found a hair on one of my towels ',\n 'This place is new and a good size restaurant in Travelodge Hotel  Full bar and good lighting and setup  Clean and service was awesome  Serving buffet everyday for       adult from     pm and you can also have a buffet to go  However  there not much choices in the buffet for the price and the food was alright  had to try a little bit of everything  Goat curry  chicken masala  chicken tandoori are main dish in the buffet and the rest are vegetarian   The goat curry was chewy they could have simmer it longer and it would have been perfect  Chicken masala was good but we had best at other restaurant   One thing I like about this place is they serve a hot fresh naan bread to your table   Will come back again due to cleanliness and good customer service and hopefully the buffet line will be more exciting   This place is conveniently right on highway     and corner of Turnpike exit  Plenty of parking ',\n 'Just opened   days ago and they are rocking it    Dirty chips  key lime pie and cottage pie Best meal in a long time',\n 'I don t usually write reviews for eye doctors  but Dr  Luke Barker and the Mann Eye staff deserve high praise  My high deductible health insurance plan was about to reset for the year when I realized I was a strong candidate for cataract surgery in each eye and premium implanted intraocular lenses  IOL  to correct my vision permanently  I called Mann Eye on December     and the team worked with me to complete my screenings and two separate cataract surgeries before January    The surgeries were painless  Dr  Barker was attentive and clearly an expert in this field  and it really was like magic  My vision is better than I could imagine    The great service could have ended there after the high tech procedures  but no  Dr  Barker has performed post op follow ups with me to fine tune my vision  He has patiently tracked my progress and genuinely cares about the outcome  The staff performs testing with state of the art equipment  and whenever possible  Mann Eye has never nickel and dimed me   I ve had eye issues since I was four years old  I figured I would always have to squint or look down at the ground instead of straight ahead  but my new lenses have changed all of that  I m more confident professionally and personally  I feel safer  and I could actually be an eye witness now    p s  If you re still not convinced  Dr  Barker has a great demeanor  and with his Tennessee accent  even words like  iritis  sound pleasant  Give Mann Eye a shot ',\n 'After a very long drive from Oklahoma  we were craving some good Mexican food  We found this one on Yelp and it was listed to be open until   pm  We walked in at  pm  to be told they just closed  I guess we will be enjoying some pizza instead    They need to update their listing ',\n 'I was born and raised in Detroit so when we discovered there was a JET S in ATX  we literally danced a jig   several jigs  a pop and lock or two and a headspin  Man  what is there to say  It is truly representative of Detroit style pizza  DO NOT order without getting the  turbo crust  treatment  If you do  you may as well forget it  Turbo crust is what makes it   That and their amazing ranch dressing which you can order bottles of  Truly  some of the best pizza there is   don t listen to any NYC pizza purist   I ve live in NY too and Jet s is in a different category   they can certainly co exist    Treat yo self and get a square pizza from Jet s   you won t regret it ',\n 'The Meatless wrap is very good  Place is clean   well taken care of  Good customer service from their staff ',\n 'I ll be the first to admit that I m not their biggest fan  but I know lots of people love these doughnuts   On our way to a party  we decided to stop and grab a dozen to go through their handy dandy drive through   It was not handy or dandy   There was one car in front of us that took no less than   min to be served       We placed our order   Get to the window    min  later   The guy gives me a total for a coffee not a dozen doughnuts   He repeats himself   more times despite me explaining to him that I did not order a coffee   I ordered a dozen doughnuts   He eventually gets it   No doughnuts packed   So  we wait while they pack a dozen plain glazed doughnuts    another who knows how many minutes   He hands me the box and the entire bottom of it is covered in sticky glaze   Awesome   Great   Where do I set this down in the car   It s now been over    minutes in the drive through   The guy is apologetic by this point  but    we won t be back   We ended up late to our party and it was definitely not worth it   This was a serious service disaster ',\n 'Well  I seem to keep waffling back and forth on my rating for this T Mo location  Still the best one in town  close to me  but also still often frustrating   My phone was lost stolen two days ago   not sure which because somewhere somehow between Kroger in Brookhaven and my parents  place it    disappeared   and no search results turned anything up       So  yesterday  we went to this T Mo to get a temp replacement and did   But it was either a bad phone or SIM card and it doesn t work  SIGH   My contacts are there but apparently it s  an emergency phone only  per the very nice guy on the customer service line       not really useful        and  oh yeah  the lady at the store told me a POB was fine for the new one to be shipped   um  no   Maybe it s time to break my contract and get a new phone and service provider      ',\n 'Don t waste what could be a good meal on mediocrity   The seafood was tough and not seasoned  the bread crumbs were soggy and the wait staff treat every one like annoying tourists   In short  if your going for the food  don t   If you are going to be waited on  don t   If you are going to say you ve been there   well I don t what to tell you   just I wish I hadn t missed a better meal in the North end ',\n 'This is my second visit and they have lots to learn   With a wait if over    minutes  tables sit for over   minutes waiting for people to respond to texts   The waiting area is cold and uncomfortable on a chilly night   The food is unremarkable  too bad  we d love a go to restaurant in Lakeway ',\n 'Good arrangement of vintage clothing neatly arranged and displayed for an easy shopping experience  They have an awesome vintage t shirt collection for rock and pop culture shirts  I was lucky enough to find a shirt that I wanted  I had a Smashing Pumpkins shirt  Just say Maybe  star shirt from the    s that my mom threw out  she thought that any alternative music was the devil s product   I saw the same shirt and wanted to get back what was originally taken for me  I wanted to rub that shirt in my mom s face at the next family dinner with the look on my face that read   I won   I get that    s shirts are now considered extremely rare and vintage  however      for a shirt that had a hole in it  Really  I ve been looking at vintage    s shirts on ebay and have seen similar condition shirts  I am currently watching for another SP shirt of better condition on Ebay  for at least      that   It s not so much the price that bothered me as that they were asking for     for a shirt that had a noticeable irreparable hole in it  I didn t even want to bother negotiating as I wouldn t be able to fix the shirt myself  Other than the whole Smashing Pumpkins t shirt annoyance  this has been the best vintage clothing store that I have come across in the lower mainland  As for annoying my mother at the next family dinner  I am still waiting for the Tool shirt to pop up that my mom threw away ',\n 'The Shoyu Ramen is my favorite of the three they offer  Tokyo style  unfussy  un gimicky purist s broth is perfect as is the   minute egg  I always order an extra slice of roast pork and and extra   minute egg  The cucumbers dressed with sesame oil and seeds balance out well  The menu is limited and I have nothing against that but how nice it would be to have a serving of gyoza pot stickers on the side   sighhhhhhh  Oh  and I love the quality of the noodles   slippery and unstarchy ',\n 'Jiu thai is not a Thai place  it specializes in northern Chinese food  the adventurous will find several novel entrees to experience on its menu  entrées not found at other Asian strip haunts  Among the best is the Cantonese classic steamed pork cake sandwich  A bargain at    a snap  these stuffed sesame rolls of minced piglet are delicious  an adjective which I think is part of the dish s name    It s been awhile since I had that piece of heaven  This spotless cove in Bethel Center offers Americanized Chinese offering too of course  and hungry for taste of the orient by proxy the American pallet I ordered Lo Mein  with steamed pork dumplings for starters  The Lo Mein will do for those jonesing for it  its attributes  plentiful quantity  juicy noodles  well prepared meat  my choice was chicken  More notable were the pork dumplings  The smoldering crust just melts in the mouth  and the rendered pork rubbed with a tad of spicy kick hits all the good spots                                                                                                                                                                      Gus  review hit the nail  this staff is efficient  fast  and industrious  They have your order up faster than the Flash  Some servers are charming with their whit and flashy  friendly idiosyncrasies  They are more than apt and able to help you through the menu    The dinning space is pretty typical for small Asian cafe set in stripmall Columbus  Not too overdone with oriental flare  soft lighting  and pictures of their food on the wall          a bottle for Tsingtao beer is must order anywhere it is served  Beer aficionados would love this Eastern classic with rice brewed bite   The prices are wonderful for the quality served and quality service  It is hard to recommend one ethnic place over another in this part of NW Columbus  being that Bamboo  Banana Leaf  and     Pho among others plying their wares here  But if you want good original Chinesse quickly at Cafe prices than you won t go wrong here ',\n 'Fantastic    Went for dine out had the tuna  angus beef and desert  Truly super  Brandon was an excellent server  David a manager introduced himself and checked to see how we were doing  Great atmosphere ',\n 'Such a disappointment  I got a custom burger for take out that was very simple  Bacon  lettuce  tomato  and ranch cooked medium rare  I got back to work with my food  the burger looked raw and was dry and tasteless despite how rare it was  There was no ranch on the burger and the burger was covered in onions that I did not order  I ve never LOVED coleslaw  but I ve never had any that I disliked  I spit their coleslaw out in one bite  The  chips  were the only part worth eating and even those were only so so    Glad I paid almost     to throw     of a burger and the rest of my meal away  I will not be returning        FOR THE SOMERVILLE LOCATION ONLY',\n 'Ambience appears to be an Asian mom   pop restaurant  Food is really good and it doesn t cost too much  Pho is noodle soup that is great on cold days ',\n 'I got an estimate and decided to use the movers  I had   movers that moved everything very fast  However  my husbands tall bureau was scratched on the entire side even know they used plastic wrap  Other movers I used in the past used blue cloth underneath the plastic  they were supposed to go   streets over to pick up my treadmill and never did  When I called them to tell them all about this they hung up the phone on me  It seems like a small place and there is no customer service or other departments to help you  I will say my husband got them all breakfast and had them sit and eat before they started and we gave each a       tip  The movers themselves did a good job but the company itself will not help you if you need it later ',\n 'This is your typical white linen hushed tones steak house   but not at all pretentious   Food is spectacular   I had the medallions with three different sauces   with the crab mac and cheese  Fantastic   My server was spot on date I informed him that I was from out of town and asked what he would reccomend to someone who may never be in town again  Spot on  Good pour   fantastic ambience   and well worth the money  In your life you will have a few memorable meals  Have one at Perry s   If you stop at the bar   ask for Taylor  She will take good care of you ',\n 'Disclaimer  the boss paid for this one so my review might be nicer than if I had to pay for this myself   The tomato lentil soup was perfectly spiced   The salad was delicious   They will make the B stilla Royale  also fantastic in its powdered sugar glory   veggie if you ask   My actual entree  Breka Vegetarian  left much to be desired   potato mush wrapped up in phyllo and deep fried a bit too long   but they have three other veggie entrees that look far better than the one I tried  and everyone s portions were enormous   The bread from the communal basket was really yummy  although I did have thoughts of swine flu and other communicable diseases in the back of my head     The decor was interesting   Our server was sarcastically entertaining but very much on top of things   The belly dancer was a bit much but she left us alone when she saw pretty clearly that we weren t interested  and it was kind of entertaining to watch the other patrons get into that    Particularly the   year old at the table next to us    I went with a large group and we had trouble all reaching the food in the middle of the table   As we left there were grumbles from some about legs falling asleep  but also sighs of happily full bellies   Good place for out of town visitors  particularly if they re from small towns that might not offer such a unique experience ',\n 'Our daughter has been at Wow and Flutterville Playopolis since I went back to work when she was   months old  We chose this school because they wear babies  follow their schedules  prioritize outdoor play  and have natural wooden toys instead of plastic stuff  Our little girl has been thriving there  and we could not be happier ',\n 'I stumbled upon this spot by accident while taking someone to JYSK  I went in to try it out   Received one pound  and then some   of vegetable pakoras for ONLY        Not a fancy place   it s a teeny hole in wall    but the pakoras are delish  I m a fan ',\n 'The service is great and the food is okay  but not spectacular ',\n 'It took us longer to order then it did for the food to arrive   Bravo    same excellent taste in less time  Thank you Red Robin   ',\n 'Amazing fries and delicious onion rings  Both have a light crispy outside with great seasoning  Great service  Creative choices for burgers  Burgers were tasty  but the meat lacks seasoning  The cheese stuffed inside is so minimal that we almost forgot there was any  We ordered the Frida Kahlo and the Chi Cheng s   The Frida was my favorite of the two  The Chi Cheng had too much sauce and made the burger salty  I also felt that the use of iceberg lettuce ruined the combination of flavors in the burger ',\n 'Probably the best place I ve had dimsum in town  I don t remember the places I went as a child   but as I can remember now  the food is yummy   Being a college student and or working when home I don t have the chance to visit the place during the non busy weekdays  It s so difficult to avoid Sundays when dimsum is making my tummy yell at me impatiently  Sundays suck though cause a majority of asian families go around lunch time after church    Gah  Sometimes the wait can be moments or even up to an hour  But  It s totally worth it   I order the same thing everytime  the shrimp noodle with the soy type sauce  Some of this  some of that  maybe something new   mmm the fried taro root  However  it s a place I d rather go with friends  with family  but never alone  Dim sum can add up  but from what I hear the prices here are cheap in comparison to what Cali has to offer sometimes   The parking lot though    It sucks   enough said ',\n 'Not living in Winter Park  I tend to always eat at the restaurants directly on Park Ave  and not venture off the main strip   Luckily this time we did for a friend s birthday dinner   Gotta say I really loved the atmosphere of this restaurant and the roominess   The food was good and typical of what I see at Mexican restaurants    I had the chicken enchiladas which came with your typical rice and re fried beans   I definitely plan on coming back    Warning           Not sure if it was because we had a large group  but unannounced to us  the     gratuity was kindly added to our check   Be careful to not tip twice by accident ',\n 'Atlanta magazine ranks this as the   th best bar in the A    This was the first time I ve visited this place so I was expecting a lot  I was not to thrilled with the size of the bar area    very small    However the staff and service was good   Great beer selection    kudos there   now the burgers    absolutely the best I ever had   I more impressed with the taste of that burger than anything else    the drinks   the valet parking   the service   just order a burger and I bet you will be beyond satisfied      Bar wise    nothing extraordinary    but burger wise    miles above the rest   ',\n 'Wonderful meat selection  and cooked to perfection  Service was wonderful as well  Excellent location to boot as well ',\n 'Benihana is a okay in my book  Is it the most traditional Japanese meal you could get  No  But that doesn t mean it s not delicious    This particular Benihana seems to draw a vast audience  Despite being right in the middle of downtown with all the big corporations  I still see many families and  casually dressed  people  Most opt for the hibachi experience  As for me  I try not to fall too much into  You are what you eat  category or rather   You smell like what you eat   which is what tends to happen when you sit at the grill  In the back  they also have a bar  a sushi bar  and a couple of tables to sit at  My co worker and I sat at a table and ordered from the grill  She got the chicken and I got the spicy chicken    The entree is      and comes with salad  fried rice  hibachi veggies and the entree  The salad is pretty fresh and comes with iceberg lettuce  matchstick carrots  tomatoes and orange ginger dressing  I though there was a bit of overkill on the dressing but otherwise  a decent salad  Fried rice is deliciously buttery as usual  The chicken was plentiful and flavorful  Generally  a decent  American Japanese place to dine for lunch    One thing I did notice  I think they use a lot of MSG or salt in their cooking because I was ridiculously thirsty for hours after my meal ',\n 'The hotel itself is decent enough  We re rarely in the rooms so the fact they are smaller isn t a big deal  and they are clean  the ac works great  The pool is great for the kids  there s a water slide and deep and shallow ends  and they include complimentary life jackets which is great  They are also open until     which on these really hot days is welcoming to cool off with  The staff has all been very nice and attentive   The worst part about this place  The food  It s horrible  The only thing that saved us is the general store that sells donuts and Doritos  We ve been eating that for breakfast and snacks  Not our first choice of food for our family  but truly it is the only thing any of us out of our entire group of    that we will eat here  I get that they are mass producing a ton of food for a ton of people  but I ve traveled quite a bit and many other large hotels have been able to do it  and ten times better  Luckily we ve had plans to visit parks and reservations at other places to eat  but on our down days we ve taken to riding to Disney Springs to eat  even though it meant a two hour excursion from getting there  finding a restaurant and then getting back here  but we ve all agreed it was worth it every time   If they could make the food better it would be a   or   star review   Pardon the typos  I ve used my phone to write this ',\n 'Can t really go wrong with this place  Good coffee  tasty light meal and lunch items  fresh baked breads  and yummy desserts   Add to that  a nice causal atmosphere to sit and read something  do your homework  or hang with friends    Aside from the  entrée items  I like their donuts here  They are not over the top with sugar  like Timmy s  and the pastry is light  moist  and fluffy ',\n 'I d never had a roast beef sandwich that wasn t from Arby s before  So  since this spot is near the gf s place  I decided to give it a try  I was tired of burgers   Maybe I don t know how to order one of these delicacies  extra sauce  onion  cheese no cheese  whatever   but it was good  That s it  Good  That s all  Good  Just good  Skip the fries   I think I prefer Arby s  gasp   ',\n 'My husband and I were visiting Portland for the first time and ended up eating dinner at Swiss Hibiscus every single night  just love the food so much  I was born and raised in Switzerland and can confirm that each dish is very authentic and in my opinion tastes better than most places in Switzerland    The first night we tried the French Onion Soup  Schnitzel with Spaetzli and the Salatteller  The second night the Garlic Shrimp  daily special   French Onion Soup  Paprika Schnitzel with Roeschti  Emince Zurichoise  Zuerigschnaetzleds  and Spaetzli  All meals were amazing but I was having dreams about that mushroom cream sauce  it s that good   My favorite Swiss Dish ever  The third night we ordered the Goulash with Spaetzli  the Emince again    and the Garlic Shrimp again  All   nights every dish was excellent as well as the service  You can feel the love the owners put into their craft  Thank you for an unforgettable experience  we will definitely be back next time we are in Portland ',\n 'Had a nice dinner on the outdoor patio area  The patio is very nice  there is a little noise from the cars on the road  I had the Beef Wellington  they claimed it was their specialty  The Wellington was really good  but I have had better  It just was nt as tender as a Wellington should be  So for the price  I was a little disappointed  We also had the Salmon  which was very good   Overall  veery nice place  its a solid   star location  but be prepared to spend   star money   ',\n ' extremely busy  on a weekend night  make reserverations     but hella fun  there isn t much to say beyond what the other peepz have already mentioned  my recommendation  however  would be to go somewhere else if you re looking for a  quiet  place to have a conversation  the high ceilings and cement glass everything don t make the best acoustic landscape      the food was excellent  i m not too much into the wine out of a tap thing    i m not a sommelier and would not be able to distinguish between brands  types  etc    but it wasn t bad   anyway  great place for a night out w  friends ',\n 'The deli can be a bit intimidating for first timers but it s worth the     minute wait in line  You can order delicious  generously sized sandwiches with a wide range of proteins  veggies  cheese and breads  The daily specials are reasonably prices for the amount of food  The prices seem to have gone up a bit in the last year or so  but it s still one of the better lunch deals in the area  Chicken sandwiches are real chicken breast  their bread is always fresh  you can order a ton of different toppings and condiments  and they also have some nice salads  drinks and snack prepared ',\n 'Ah  couldn t wait to visit the famous Voodoo doughnut on our trip to Portland  I tried the cap n crunch donut that I ve seen on TV a few times  I was pretty underwhelmed  It was OK  but didn t really live up to the hype at all  and not worth waiting in line so long only to be hurried along by the unfriendly staff when its your turn to order  while being overwhelmed trying to choose something  And they don t even have coffee  Everyone wants coffee with a donut  right  Plus  it s cash only  What year is it  people   The best memory I have is a man in a bronze art adorned van that showed up and started dancing in the street in a monkey mask  only for my grandpa to join him  If you re lucky  you ll see him too  I mean  I would probably come back to try some other donuts  but since I live      miles away  that isn t going to happen anytime soon ',\n 'It s a cute place to hang out  Nice warm ambience  The food is pretty good  and reasonably priced  We went for brunch on a weekday and it turned out awesome  They have a lot of egg options  My hubby ordered duck and sweet potato hash  and he loved it  Generous portion  Well cooked  I had blueberry pancakes which were really good  I definitely recommend this place ',\n 'I came here for a hungry bite to eat   We just finished with a business seminar and it was about time we had something to put into our tummies   Great location  just right on the Main Street of Lake Mary Blvd which gets pretty busy during the week but there were plenty of available parking spaces during a late Saturday afternoon   The restaurant was empty  clean and great like all the rest of the Panera locations I visited   Great customer service and very little waiting time for our food   I ordered from the  You pick two  menu  a half Steak   Arugula Sandwich made with Seared steak  arugula  vine ripened tomatoes  pickled onions  garlic and herb cream cheese spread and mustard horseradish sauce on sour dough bread was my favorite out of the     It was delicious   But the clam chowder was okay  not my favorite  but will do to satisfy my appetite   It was a great location  but I always have great experiences with Panera   There wasn t anything that stood out from the rest of them ',\n 'I m going to be honest here    I used to hate the Whip  H A T E   The food always seemed ho hum  and I guess that I always just picked the wrong time to go when it was just too busy or I was not in the mood or blah blah blah blah blah  Anyways    hate no longer   Why  you might ask  For one  The Havana Rice Bowl  Yes  one dish almost single handedly changed my mind  I had had the California Benny before and it was always just too much hollandaise  weird chunky tomatoes    bleh    But the Havana Rice Bowl  with added avocado and a swack of hotsauce  is hangover brunch heaven  Wash it down with a Manmosa to take your brunch to the next level  Also  have I mentioned that they have a wonderful assortment of beers    Furthermore  the staff here are lovely  Super friendly  attentive  and just all around swell folks    The Whip is now in my regular rotation of Mt Pleasant haunts  and I anticipate that it will be for some time ',\n 'Food and service were great  Came after lunch and had no wait  Ended up parking around the corner  but what else to expect in ATL  Will come back if in the area again ',\n 'Wow  I m really surprised at all the bad reviews on here  Yeah  the walls were full of graffiti  but thats not something they can help  They just so happen to be next to a University  with a bunch of college kids who seem to enjoy writing on the walls   The food was amazing  My boyfriend said it was the best quesadilla he s ever had  I had the chicken fajita  and it was great  The chicken was juicy and flavorful  The rest of the veggies were great too   Our server was the cutest  quirkiest girl ever  And she was very attentive and helpful   My boyfriend and I really like the place  and we plan to be back ',\n 'I had the   course lunch for     dollars with   people   We started of with the duck samosas  which I thought were a unique combination   They were okay  Just okay  Nothing wow   For the  st course  I ordered the hot and sour soup  which I didn t particularly like  Too water  no flavor   My friend ordered the noodle and watermelon salad  which we all loved   Then I ordered the Desi chili chicken  which I actually liked and my two friends ordered a lamb dish and we liked that as well   They should give customers the option of ordering basmati rice  which I actually prefer having  as opposed to just giving us the sticky rice  which I don t like    The desert  was vanilla ice cream with a lechee and it was actually quite good    The mistake we made was ordering a pitcher of Sangria  which cost     dollars  It was pathetically bad   I d advise them to stick to beer and wine  Don t order the Sangria   Overall  for     bucks  it s a good deal on Newbury street   The food is quite flavorful and it s pretty light   The portion sizes are just right   The outdoor sitting is very cramped and the waiters kept dropping plates  luckily none dropped on me   They even tried to squeeze a table right below the stairs  Really  Not   So  I think the     dollar     course deal is to try and get more people in there   For that price  it s not too bad ',\n 'Its dependable Injun food and they have a great staff  I think they have the best nann but I aint picky  Our favorites are the Sagg Paneer and the Chicken Tikka Masala  We order about   times a month for take out and its dependable ',\n 'I came here for a late  boozy lunch on a Friday  The staff were ever so friendly  we sat at the bar and got beers  veggie hotdogs and veggie chilli cheese waffle fries  It was all so good  The service was exemplary and the food left us full and satisfied  I d love to see a more inventive veggie vegan option on the menu though ',\n 'Been meaning to try this place and so glad I finally did  Amazing selection of baked goods  Very hard to choose  Prices are very affordable and we had good service  No card minimum either which was great considering all I got was a cherry Danish for under    Definitely going back ',\n 'LOVE their pizza   They delivered    extra large pizza s to our place of business for an employee appreciation event  Everyone raved about the flavors  crust and toppings  Its a hidden treasure  kind of out of the way but worth the try  YUM YUM YUM ',\n 'We had some of the best service we had in Atlanta at this Friday s LB is the servers name and the manager who is the kitchen manager is a gentleman with terrific people skills',\n 'The Flower Factory was my first choice in florists to book for my wedding until I called in for an adjustment to my first consultation  I was looking to increase my spend with them    I was shocked at how rude the lady was on the phone  I didn t get her name but she told me that they don t re quote and if I wanted any changes I would have to sign a contract and pay a deposit first  How could I possibly have made up my mind when all I had was a    minute consult and rough costs   I expected more from them and am so disappointed at the way I was spoken to on the phone   The person was so rude and short with me  I didn t realize that by wanting to spend more money meant I got treated worse  This experience had totally put me off from ever wanting to support this business   Really sad because they were the florist that my fiancé bought me my first bouquet of flowers from and I thought it would be so sweet to book them for our wedding  Beautiful shop and flowers but horrible service and experience  Never going back ',\n 'Love this place   After a bad waxing experience  I came here with uneven brows  I was a bit nervous because I had never tried threading before but I ended up loving the experience  As opposed to waxing  there is no redness to deal with afterwards  Moreover  with the help of Ranju  I was able to leave with nicely shaped brows    The only con about this place is that it is a little out of the way  have to take a bus or drive up there  but it s worth the trip  I m an official threading convert ',\n 'Sweet playground  Drive to it because you re not going to want to walk around till you find it ',\n 'Grand variety of flavors with detailed nutritional info  cute and bright store  great for hangout  specially after the movies    I saw a sticker on the door  no shirt no shoes   no froyo   Not sure what it meant       Anyways  I got their peach mango flavor because I like tart froyo  I always top off my froyo with Mochi rice and strawberries  which they had  They have a lot of dry toppings available  Not as much fresh fruits though  I only saw strawberry  pineapple  mango   It could also be because I came in    min before their closing time    If it wasn t that late I would ve gotten their latte flavor  It says made with real coffee so I was worried about the caffeine and staying up all night  Their cheesecake flavor was very creamy and definitely tasted like it  I also saw an almond biscotti which was made with real almond milk    The one complaint I have is the way the store is shaped  There s not enough room in the tiny isle where we get the yogurt  The round shaped cashier area crams everyone there  It can only hold one person at a time  So if I wanted to try the next flavor while someone tastes another one  I would have to wait for that person to move  I gotta say I m a petite person and if I can t go through the space  it means there s  really not much space  And when there s     people in that isle waiting to try the yogurt     it feels like rush hour traffic   There s a chalkboard area for kids to draw  I thought it was very nice    Menchies also has a lot of merchandise  Cute buttons  pencils  keychains  shirts etc    And lastly  I found out they make froyo cake too  Now I know where to order my birthday cake this year ',\n 'Yum  yum  This restaurant is small but cozy  The food was great  Good flavors  GREAT service  I am coming back ',\n 'I ve lived in Austin a long time  Long enough that when a group of co workers suggested eating here  I was enormously embarrassed that I had never been here before  Sitting in the new location made me feel even more so as the ambiance is everything I love about Austin  Funky  quirky  comfy  cute  I am a meat eater who s second favorite protein is tofu  I am always open to vegetarian food and was really impressed by the menu  I know many in our group of folks were not vegetarian and yet everyone enjoyed their food  I took the easy route and got a grilled cheese  lame  I know  but it was soooo good  From the types of cheese on the sammie to the layer of basil leaves  the flavor was right on and a filling choice  Of course  once our food came I looked around and wish I had selected something a little less simple as everything looked great  I did get a Nutella latte and it was delish  Of course  you could spread Nutella on a shoe and I d eat it  I will definitely be back as this is a great option for my veggie friends ',\n 'I have gone for years to the DykeNight second saturdays  While they re fun and it s the biggest game in town  every single one of my friends has the same complaint  THE MUSIC IS NOT FUN  It s just the same tired techno remix thumpa thumpa crap again and again  The music in the outside room is ten times better  it s a fun mix of hip hip   As a place to dance  Machine sucks  PLEASE  PLEASE change the music  I can t be the only person who s complained  Please play some hip hip  ',\n 'Super good   super friendly  This was my first Austin  taco truck  experience and it turned out really good  My husband and I were just leaving a Yelp  event and it was on the way to our car    I had the beef taco and the spicy chicken taco   My husband had the beef burrito   It was really quick and the staff was really friendly   One of them chatted with us about the Yelp  event and said that she s been trying to get up to elite status    I couldn t tell the difference between the chicken or the beef but one of them had bones  maybe that one was the chicken one   Either way they were both delish   My husband s burrito was too spicy hot for him and he even nixed the salsa   hmmm     The tacos were just the right amount of spice for me   Oh and   tacos     burrito was only   bucks  can t beat that ',\n 'I am in agreement with Ashley C s review    I wanted to give Hobos a try for the longest time  I went there for the happy hour  The decor was nice  and it is actually rather spacious inside  The waiter was nice and helpful  too    The beer was good  but the happy hour food   in comparison  it doesn t match to Jake s or Henry s   I really hope that Hobos would revamp happy hour food  Keep the fries and tortilla  But add a salad  make it huge   a burger  and I am hoping their dinner plates are as good as Rachel Ray said    But overall  if you don t want to be in a crowded happy hour place  Hobos is actually a decent alternative ',\n 'The best ride in the park is the mummy IF YOU LIKE ROLLER COASTERS  A lot of the rides say that if you are this or that you can t ride  The cat in the hat is not scary and pregnant women CAN ride it in my opinion  It does not spin and will hurt anything if you are not   months pregnant  The hulk and the dragon are also awesome  I suggest booking to come in feb  march or apr     however  the ticket lines are RETARDED  We bought our tickets off site and still had to stand in line for an hour to get the vouchers  Even if you buy them online you have to stand in line to get the actual ticket  from the clerk and it takes forever  You need at least   days to get through universal and islands of adventure  If you are trying to park a camper turn at the valet ']",

       "|Some good things about Alibi  comfortable areas to sit and talk with a small or large group of people  the kind of lighting that makes people look prettier  perfectly pleasant and not too loud music  plenty of people but not at all crowded  decent drinks  close to the red line at Charles MGH  cheap and quick and friendly valet parking  only     if you get your ticket validated at Alibi or Clink    a great deal in a neighborhood where street parking is slim pickings especially when there s a Celtics game or some other event at the Garden    Some annoying things  long lines outside on freezing cold Friday nights are one thing if a place really is at capacity  but doing it for effect is just obnoxious  after waiting for at least twenty minutes to get in  my friends and I realized that holding back the floods had not been strictly necessary  they easily could have let in the whole line  maybe    people  without making the place uncomfortably full  Then four of our friends who got there after we did  they arrived around ten  waited for over an hour  including about    minutes  at the very front of the line   and finally ended up leaving to avoid frostbite  Maybe they weren t wearing enough makeup or something  but this one bouncer was really rudely power trippy about the whole thing  In general the staff members  other than the valets  were not great  for example our clueless cocktail waitress about whom one of my friends speculated charitably that it was probably her first day  She would come back to our table after ten minutes to point at someone and say    Are  you  the one who ordered the pinot noir   Also  given that a martini glass with an olive laden toothpick sticking out of it is one of the most iconic images in America I was pretty unimpressed that she brought over my dirty martini with no olives in it and apparently  didn t know that martinis are supposed to come with olives   The jailhouse themed decor was kind of cool in a novelty way  although I would have preferred to sit by a mugshot like Michael Jagger or Francis Sinatra rather than having to stare at Paris Hilton s giant sultry gaze  And I can imagine it might be a decent  if expensive  after work hangout if I worked in Boston  especially at MGH  which is right next door  But given that I do not I probably won t be back |N    |\n",

wanted too just take a bite out of a fully grown hogs gut  That is what the five guys experience is about for me  The burgers are unreal and extremely good  Also they are generous with the fries that overflow into the bag  but the amount of fries used to be better  But the one thing that is distracting from the experience is all of the peanut corpses littered around the place  It is nut genocide

delicious and exceeded expectations  We loved the lobster Napoleon  but I wouldn t order it again unless we were splurging  The steak is  so delicious and filling that you won t need an appetizer  The truffle mashed potatoes were delicious  but they were also what we expected from this quality of restaurant  The mac and cheese was good  but not our favorite kind  It tasted like it was trying too hard   I personally would pass on the cheesecake  It was good  but not spectacular   The point of this story is that the steak was so good  the waiter could ve slapped my mother in front of me  and I

Alibi  comfortable areas to sit and talk with a small or large group of people  the kind of lighting that makes people look prettier  perfectly pleasant and not too loud music  plenty of people but not at all crowded  decent drinks  close to the red line at Charles MGH  cheap and quick and friendly valet parking  only     if you get your ticket validated at Alibi or Clink    a great deal in a neighborhood where street parking is slim pickings especially when there s a Celtics game or some other event at the Garden    Some annoying things  long lines outside on freezing cold Friday nights are one thing if a place really is at capacity  but doing it for effect is just obnoxious  after waiting for at least twenty minutes to get in  my friends and I realized that holding back the floods had not been strictly necessary  they easily could have let in the whole line  maybe    people  without making the place uncomfortably full  Then four of our friends who got there after we did  they arrived around ten  waited for over an hour  including about    minutes  at the very front of the line   and finally ended up leaving to avoid frostbite  Maybe they weren t wearing enough makeup or something  but this one bouncer was really rudely power trippy about the whole thing  In general the staff members  other than the valets  were not great  for example our clueless cocktail waitress about whom one of my friends speculated charitably that it was probably her first day  She would come back to our table after ten minutes to point at someone and say    Are  you  the one who ordered the pinot noir   Also  given that a martini glass with an olive laden toothpick sticking out of it is one of the most iconic images in America I was pretty unimpressed that she brought over my dirty martini with no olives in it and apparently  didn t know that martinis are supposed to come with olives   The jailhouse themed decor was kind of cool in a novelty way  although I would have preferred
