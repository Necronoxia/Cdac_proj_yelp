But by far the worst of this whole experience are the unseen charges placed on your bill after you exit. It may not seem like much to add $10 fuel charge to a tank that is already full and that you have photographed, you will spend days trying to get those charges removed. The corporate office is obviously full of leaders that are so incompetent they have no idea how to provide their customers with good quality service.

But nobody called, so here is my review.\\nAfter spending some time on researching for a best place for Botox in Austin, I have stopped my choice on this one. I went for my first Botox at 33 and lip injection a month ago. They seemed very nice friendly ladies. After quick consultation the appointment was made, they were nice enough to squeeze me in their busy schedule. At the consultation Dr. Wright. told me that I would need 20 units of Botox for my forehead, 10 between my eye brows and 10 on my forehead. Plus a half of the syringe of juviderm ultra into my lips. \\nThe procedure was pretty painless. But the Dr Wright has changed the the dosage and did 16 units of Botox between my eye brows and 8 units into my forehead, which left me a little confused and concerned. \\nMy lips were swollen next day and in couple days I couldn't even tell if anything was done on my lips. But that's fine, I wanted it to be very natural. \\nThe area between my eyes was totally frozen next morning, but my forehead (the main reason I did Botox) didn't change at all. Dr. warned me at would take a week or so to see the results on my forehead. So I waited a week and not seeing any changes called to them to ask if it's ok, because I was leaving Taxes for a while, and will not be able to visit them after I leave. They said I have to wait two weeks at least to the full affect and told me not to come for follow up. \\nAfter two weeks my forehead was still the same in the middle,  except the area where the needle went on both sides. \\nSo my 11 area is totally frozen for nothing (I have never had wrinkles there)  and  my forehead wrinkles are still there. I called them to ask for an advice how to fix it now, but nobody called me back. Very disappointing and unprofessional. I know everyone is different and have different skin but I do feel the dosage of Botox was wrong. Also their Yelp ad says they offer military discount, but the receptionist said they don't. So many good reviews here but almost no pictures of clients... should have been a red flag for me, wasted money:(\\nUpdate \\n5 month later . All wrinkles were back within less 2 month. But my 11 is still frozen. I can't do nothing until it goes away. \\nUnprofessional\",\n",

       " 'Got a small wrist tat back in December 2014 by a guy named Austin Gervias here. When I went in for a consultation to talk about the piece, I told him what I wanted and how I wanted it. He told me the way I wanted it (my tattoo facing me and not outwards) was the \"wrong\" way. It almost came off as kind of \"elitest\", like \"your tattoo is wrong, but okay, it\\'s gonna be on your skin\" which kind of made me feel off-put and dumb. Does it really matter? I mean a tattoo is a tatttoo is a tattoo is a tattoo is a tattoo, no matter what it is or which direction it\\'s facing.\\n\\nMy tat had a lettering in it, so when the day came, he showed me some of the original designs he had drafted up for the wording. I decided on one but there was one little thing I wanted to change about it. When I asked him if we could change it, he IMMEDIATELY without a second thought said \"no, it won\\'t be correct if we do it that way\" and that just kind of shocked me that he would say that to me... and then after a while of uncomfortable silence, he said something along the lines of \"but it\\'s your skin so i guess\". At that point I kind of just wanted to walk out because I kind of felt like I was being disrespected, but I decided to stay put. Like... really? I get that as an artist you can have preferences but I mean for small things like which way I wanted my tat facing or how I wanted my letting to look, I don\\'t think the elitest sassy attitude was needed.\\n\\nThe tatting itself went fine. I just sat in a chair in the back room with my arm on a padded table. At one point, some random dude comes over, doesn\\'t even give me a second look, talks to Austin as he\\'s tatting me, leans over me to get a look at my arm,  and then comments on how detailed the tat is, and then walks away. Like I don\\'t know about you but I don\\'t want some stranger ignoring me and leaning over me to look at my tat without giving me a second thought and talk my my artist while I\\'m getting tatted, like, this is kind of an intimate deal for me.\\n\\nAfterwards, when it was all over, he just shook my hand and that was sort of my cue like \"you\\'re done now you can leave\". No wrapping my new tat in plastic, no after-tat care instruction, no cream recommendation... nothing. I had to get all that information from elsewhere. This was not my first but my second tattoo, but it had been a while and I needed a refresher course and would have liked to get that information, but I ended up having to get it from other friends instead.\\n\\nI am happy with the way my tat turned out in the end, it was great for the price I paid for it, but my initial reaction to how I was talked to/treated was intimidating and off putting, so I will DEFINITELY not come here again.',\n",

I was so excited they were building a Tiny\\'s in Austin. Except once it opened, it\\'s quality of service was clearly very poor. FOR THIS REASON: I will only place TO-GO orders whenever I eat at Austin\\'s TB. \\n\\nThis fine Saturday afternoon I came into pick up my single Turkey Avacado Club TO-GO order. Over the phone they said it\\'d be 10-15 minutes. I arrived 30 minutes later, to the staff telling me there there\\'s not a single TO-GO order for me. After inconclusive answers from the waitstaff, I realized the order was placed in TB Houston. {who I had to call myself to cancel the order and they were so nice about the mixup and delightful to talk to, might I add} \\n\\nHungry and disappointed, I asked if I could place another sandwich TO-GO and if it could be ready in about 10-15 minutes. The staff member asked her manager who confirmed. I thanked them and gave my appreciation with a nicer than normal tip. \\n\\nWaited in my car for 10 minutes and came back inside to get the drinks and wait for the food. Had been keeping my eye on the manager/staff (with nothing else to do but wait) and noticed a problem went down with \"2 separate orders\". Once I\\'d been waiting close to 25 minutes, I asked what the holdup was. The bar staff (in charge of TO-GO orders) was unhelpful AS ALWAYS and to make matters worse she was texting behind the bar when she had drink orders lined up. \\n\\n30 minutes later, the manager who took charge of my order (probably because her staff is so incompetent) came to me with my Club Sandwhich TOGO. Praise the Lord.\\n\\nShe apologized (which I thanked her for). Then she tells me that my original TO-GO order was accidentally given away to another customer who came in, hence the mix up with \"2 separate orders\". Then nothing. \\n\\nI stared at her. \\nI was speechless. \\nI had been sitting right in front of them waiting for my TO-GO order while it was given away, THEN kept in the dark waiting for 30 minutes all the while getting less help and information and more hungry and irritable.\\nLike I said, I was speechless. \\nI started at her and said \"well...\" & she just walked away. I shouldn\\'t be paying for this???!\\n\\nThis kind of restaurant that charges $$$ for food (which is tasty) and then has the most blatantly rude service (throughout the ladder) is a waste of time - and if you try to avoid wasting time by placing a TO-GO order, then it\\'s also a waste of money.',\n",

       " 'SAY YES TO THE DRESS BUT NO TO THE STORE - STUCK FOR $450! BUYER BEWARE\\n\\n\\nMy customer experience with Bridals By Lori BBL - advertised and supported by the TLC a discovery Chanel \"Say Yes to the Dress\" was one of the worst experiences possible!  My customer experience with this store was far from exemplary in demonstrating any level of quality customer service.  I came to the store to purchase a wedding gown.  I found a beautiful gown, was pressured into a sale with an offer of a 12  1/2% discount if purchasing the dress the same day.  I did leave and come back the same day.  At which point I was then informed that the dress would not be available for my wedding date in April 2014 (this was now October 2013) even though there was a gown in the designer\\'s inventory, unless I paid an additional $250 expediting fee! This was not a rush cut or special order.  It was an order of a gown that existed in the manufacturer\\'s inventory. When I questioned a $250 up charge for ordering a dress that existed in inventory at the manufacturer, I was adamantly told that this charge was being made by the manufacturer and just being passed through.   I was very uneasy about what I was being told but I did want the gown so I moved forward with the purchase.\\n\\nThe next phase of customer non-service was with the actual purchase.  This was after 5pm.  I found that this store does NOT accept American Express.  I had a problem with my MasterCard (waiting for a replacement card) and asked if they would hold the gown until the next day.  I even offered a small check to hold the purchase and they refused.  Unluckily for me my fiancée had received the card in the mail and I called the house, got my credit card number and completed the transaction that evening.  I was soo frazzled that I didn\\'t realize that they charged the entire gown on my card.\\n\\nNow comes the really bad part - I read the contract and ignored the part about a CANCELLATION PENALTY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE PURCHASE!  Now you might say - well if you want the gown so what.  The so what happened the next morning when I looked on line for a picture of the gown to send to a friend and saw the gown for 40% $800 less than what I was paying for it!    I found this 40% pricing difference, quite by chance when looking online for a picture of the gown.  This is a huge difference and from a qualified distributer of the manufacturer, not a fly by night!  When I called the store, they refused to negotiate anything.   I found them to be totally rigid in every manner.  They even refused to credit anything back until I called my lawyer at which point they credited back the dress minus the $450 cancellation fee!\\n\\nOf course I realize at this point, I was quite foolish in ever signing such an agreement.  A total lapse in common sense in my part.  I probably signed this because I was so stressed over getting my credit card information and the fact that they absolutely refused to hold the purchase until the next day.  I can absolutely tell you that normally, I would never have signed this.  I would have immediately gone elsewhere to shop for my gown.\\n \\nAny organization that feels the need to have a clause with a large penalty for cancellation within 24 hours of an agreement is obviously questionable in my opinion.    I might understand it for a special cut or order but not an inventory item!\\n \\nOf course their business practices are their decision, however, in all fairness - I purchased the gown after 5 pm Friday and tried to contact them before noon on Saturday the next day.  They did not return my call until after 3pm that day.  Yes I know that regardless technically I was still within the 24 hours but then I was SCRXXED the second I signed this agreement.  \\n \\nAs to the expediting fee - umm there is none.  I ordered the gown from a different shop and there is no expediting fee for a gown in inventory.   I also called the manufacturer and they were not aware of any up charges related to existing merchandise that was in inventory.  I have received the gown within 2 weeks of my purchase through another store.\\n \\nThere was not one part of this experience that was of any pleasure - right down to the end where it appears I am \"stuck\" for $450.   Atlanta is known for customer service and reputation / word of mouth here is of huge importance.',\n",

Several months ago my 7 year old lab started having back problems that were orginially treated at AM/PM a year earlier during emergency hours.  I took him to AM/PM thinking it was the same problem he had before.  Also, I thought I should go back since he had x-rays from there and had been treated successfully before.  I thought I would take him, they would put him on the same medicine and I would have my happy dog back in a couple days.  \\n\\nThey put him on the same medication he was on before but ran some very expensive tests and determined he also had a liver infection - which later specialist agreed he never had.  They put him on new medication that was very expensive and said he should be better in a couple weeks.  Several weeks passed by and he wasn't getting any better so I took him back.  We saw a different doctor this time.  We had to go through the entire spill about the dog, his history, how he had been treated, etc.  This doctor thought it was something completely different and put him on different very expensive medicine.  Finally, after another several weeks he was getting worse, he was to the point that he wasnt able to walk and was miserable.  I took him back again.  Once again, a different doctor.  You would think that if the dog was this sick and had been in several times they would have the same doctor see him.  Once again, we went through the entire spill of what was wrong with him, etc.  This doctor thought he had a bone stuck in his esophagus and tried to send us to a specialist to take x-rays to confirm her suspicion - which would have cost over $3000.  At this point we had enough of AM/PM and took him to a different vet - Ben White Animal Hospital - for a second opinion.\\n\\nThey agreed that the vet at AM/PM was wrong about the esophagus diagnosis and thought he was probably having muscular problems and referred us to a specialist.  We eventually had to put him down because he was sick for too long to recover from the damage.  The vets at Ben White were there for us and were amazing people - I wish I would have taken Django to him first so that he may still be with us today.  They thoroughly explained everthing to us and are very good vets. They were also honest about not knowing what was wrong with him.  \\n\\nThroughout the entire experience these are the major problems I had with AM/PM:\\nA different doctor everytime and each one was dead wrong on diagnosis.  None of the vets seemed that concerned that my dog was very sick - maybe if the same dr would have seen him and could have seen the progression of his illness they would have understood and been more concerned.  Staff was not helpful at all!  I waited several times in the lobby to pay for my visit holding a very sick dog while the front desk staff took their dear sweet time to wait on me.  Also, he is a large dog and they never offered assistance getting him to the car, etc.  When I received medications there was no instructions, or information about the drugs.  Each time I left I was very confused about what was wrong with my dog and with what the vets told me - they never explained very well what was going on.  The rates and medications were very expensive and everytime I went there they wanted to run more tests and run up my bill.  And finally, I never received any follow up calls from the hospital.  \\n\\nPlease never take your animals to this place!!!  I really regret that I took him there and am upset with myself for not getting a second opinion sooner.  The entire process was very confusing and upsetting and I was led to believe that my dogs illness was undiagnosable, only to find out it was just the vet I was taking him to the entire time.\",\n",

After sending our server back at least once to ask about menu selections (she was clueless as to what the ice creams were and something else we asked about, too), we all ordered.  Three \"fountain sodas\", one side of cheese and a salad.  You\\'d think this is all very simple food and hard to mess up.  You\\'d think wrong.\\n\\nFirst the \"sodas\" - when I think \"soda\" I think carbonation and fizz.  All three (each a different flavor:  one hibiscus, one orange spice and one elderberry (I think it was) vanilla) were completely lacking in fizz and almost completely devoid of any flavor whatsoever.  The hibiscus was the most flavorful, but still nothing I would ever want to drink.  If they are supposed to be \"tea\" then call them that, because it\\'s pretty disappointing to have your \"soda\" taste like this.  The waitress told us that they had some difficulty with the flavors because the syrups had not come in and when they finally did, they were the wrong ones.  But the menu says, \"homemade\".  Homemade implies, to me, that the chef/cook/whoever in the back made a simple syrup, added fruits, etc and created a delicious and tasty syrup.  So, which is it (minus the delicious and tasty, of course...)?  When the waitress cleared the table at the end of the meal, the hibiscus was all gone, half of the orange remained and 3/4 of the berry thing remained.  Did she ask at all if they were ok?  Nope.  Huge missed opportunity to improve our experience.\\n\\nMy salad was completely bland and about 1/6 of the lettuce was brown, wilted or slimy looking.  The dressing was completely lacking any flavor.  It was a regular sized (small) dinner salad and cost $6.  What a ripoff.  I was concerned for my well-being after eating what parts of it I did.\\n\\nMy companion\\'s cheese was fine.  Cheddar cheese hacked off a larger piece of cheddar cheese.

We have purchased a few beds from them and had no issues.\\n\\nUpdate 2.  We reordered the recommended couch.  It was a complete fiasco between calling the store and calling customer support.   They informed us they will discuss a discount for the headache but only after the furniture is delivered.... wife explained this doesn\\'t make sense.

I picture a half wit staring at a spreadsheet concluding, if we negotiate after furniture is delivered ... half the requests for discounts go away because people are tired of fighting with us , and the other half ... well they have no leverage.

The siding was off when Ian came to quote the job and when you completed the job. When the siding when to be installed it was discovered that the aluminum wrap was installed with a huge run off and gap, not flat against the house so impossible to install the siding. So saying it has to be bent a different way makes zero sense. It is pathetic and cowardly they wouldn\\'t even send someone here for 5 minutes to discuss with me in person, although I would still be willing to if they wanted to come see my face to face. I was very respectful when you told me you were tied up for a month and you told me you were willing to work with me. In reality, you were pushing me off so the gap in time was longer from the actual job so you could make an excuse not to come out. Everything in this comment is a lie, I am very disappointed on how dishonest and disrespectful this company is.\\n\\nORIGINAL POST: The company installed a total of 40\\' of gutters and one 4\\' piece of fascia trim that runs off 1.25\" to an existing piece of fascia trim. That run off creates a large gap from the fascia to the exterior wall and doesn\\'t allow the siding to be nailed into anything, multiple vertical 2x4 shims would be required to make up for the gap in order to have something to nail the siding to, this would also create a hump on the exterior wall.  \\nInitially Ian Zmud came to my house to review the job, he said he would call if anything came up during the job because his crew are professionals and might see something that he didn\\'t. We did discuss how much trim needed to be replaced and I said only what trim needs to be replaced because I did not know exactly. Ian was great and helpful at the time. \\nThe job was completed on Friday June 7th when I was not home. The siding was ordered and took a couple weeks to come in through Lowes (messed up delivery and a special color), by the time the siding started going up (June 29, I realized this issue when I was measuring up from the top of the exterior wall and saw the gap. I texted the Chris, the owner, with photos and a description, who said everyone is on a commercial job for 1 month. I said that is ok I want to work with you to get this resolved because I will have work in the future and want to stay in good standing. He agreed and said to touch base, I call him back a week later and says he will touch base with me in two weeks because they are still busy, I called him 2.5 weeks later (7/29) to review the situation again (after we did a few times via text and on the phone) and this is when he said he cannot help me out because the job is not big enough and I already had paid.

       " \"If I could give this zero stars I would. I showed up with five other woman for a girlfriends birthday. Stood in line for not even 5 minutes, then had security come and tell us we needed to leave. When we asked why they said we weren't welcome in the establishment, and we needed to leave immediately other wise we were trespassing.. So I asked the other security guy why this had happened and he laughed in my face, didn't say a word and went back to checking ids. Considering we were completely sober, and had dressed to the venue, I am shocked they can get away with treating PAYING CUSTOMERS like this. I will NEVER be back, and will be passing the word along. \\n\\nSeeing the reviews below, I am surprised they have customers still.\",\n",
       " \"Took a red eye from SFO.  I have been waiting since 9am for my room. It's now 3:30 pm. I just want to lay down and take a nap. Still no fucking room.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 9/25 - They said they were upgrading me to a suite, got to the room and it was a run of the mill room. Smells like old carpet. The toilet would not flush... Im over it, not even gonna try to deal with that...\\n\\nWas supposed to stay thru Friday but booked a room at the DoubleTree Suites. \\n\\nBye bye Wyndham, never again.\",\n",
       " 'I love Buffalo Wild Wings... but the service here was terrible... a simple take out of wings and cheese curds took 40 mins was over 20 dollars and I had to go back once I realized I had no utensils no napkins and no sauce.... this makes me miss NY customer service.',\n",
       " \"I have been here twice, and services has been horrible. First time we sat with a waitress and she said it was her first day, and they kept overloading her area. \\n\\nSecond time we walked in and no one was at the hostage stand with three employees standing to the left not helping anyone. We waited about five minutes to be greeted and sat. During our time we noticed our server sitting down with empty plates in front of us. Then were handed the check when we weren't even done drinking/watching the games. \\n\\nNever again\",\n",
       " \"4 people working, but they seem to have to double up to help ever customer. Don't know if there's a problem with every reservation but it takes them 15 minutes to process every customer. Ridiculous.\",\n",

       " \"I took my car here around July, and I thought they did a good job. Plus I loved how they gave me a report of everything. After paying and leaving there still was work needed In my car Which I know since it said it on the report. I had my step dad check out the problems they lied! They said I needed new back brakes we checked they were brand new. When in the report it said it was worn and needed them badly! Meaning they are just trying to sponge people for money!                                 Second the charge for the parts is ridiculous they give generic brands, and expect you to pay as if it was name brand from a dealership!                            Third I went back today to see if I can get a diagnosis on my car because I live close and explained to the owner my last problem and she assured me she will look at everything to make sure it was done right. I came in at 2:30 and was told they would have my car done today. Yet they didn't call me until 5:02 to tell me they didnt finish and to come back tomorrow when they close at 6. That made me furious because I have work and wanted to get things fixed. Now I just wasted my day waiting for nothing. They have horrible customer service. I don't trust them at all and would not Recommend them to anyone! If you are smart you will never spend a dime at this place!\",\n",
       " \"Terrible management. This isn't the first time, now that I recall but, don't order for here. We spent EXTRA money using the delivery service and got completely wrong orders. I called them and they put me on hold for 30 mins. I called back 5 times to a busy tone. Hope you lost business and I'll be in to give you a price oft mind soon. It's really not hard people. It's few ingredients in assembly line and for a multi million dollar corporation to ignore a customer with zero customer service and no manger to answer my call...yeah, not ok.\",\n",

They obviously use a very CHEAP top coat. It is peeling and cracking already. A complete waste of money!!!!! I should NOT have to be getting my nails re-done this soon. I have NEVER had this happen at any other shop before. As much as y'all charge you all need to purchase QUALITY supplies for your clients. I will not be returning!!! Don't waste your money.\",\n",
