       " 'This review is solely about the breakfast service   I used to come here every weekday morning for breakfast tacos and coffee on my way to work  A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift  and since then the service at breakfast has declined sharply    The guy who used to run the counter at breakfast was cheerful  courteous  and FAST  There were plenty of all the different types of tacos wrapped and ready to go  and I could grab my coffee  choose my tacos  pay and leave in less than five minutes  usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet   The first time I went since that guy left  there were two new guys  one running the counter and the other preparing the tacos  Both of the kinds I usually get weren t ready  and the taco prepper took a while to make the tacos  then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready  I stood there for several minutes until the cashier noticed the bag sitting there  even after I told him they were ready and had been set down    The last time I went there  there was only one customer ahead of me in line  who looked tense and irate  waiting for the same  taco prepper  guy from the previous time to fix his tacos  he usually wears a bandana on his head   This time he was also running the register  I got my coffee  waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid   The guy came and took my order  started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my tacos  Then he asked me if I was okay  I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed   and I told him I was just in a rush  Then he loudly said that they re never in a rush at Live Oak Market  and I told him that they used to be  and that I used to be able to get my order quickly  He told me to have a nice day  and I left    I ve worked in customer service for years  including working as a barista at a busy coffee shop  and I find the notion that  rushing  during what is known as  rush hour  on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable  The primary reason people stop there is because  yes  the tacos are good and so is the coffee  supporting local businesses is important  AND because you can jump out of your car  grab your food and coffee  and get back on the road in five minutes or less  or you should be able to  rather   If you re not prepared to  rush  between the hours of   and   a m  on a weekday  and you re serving breakfast and coffee  then you re in the wrong business   Luckily  a family owned taco truck opened directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot  Their tacos are less expensive  taste much better  the staff is friendly  and they re always ready when you get there  So  no more Live Oak for me in the mornings  I make my own coffee and get tacos across the street     During the rest of the day  the staff is great  and I still love the store in general  but I hope they replace their early morning staff  ',\n",

it   The rest is spent waiting   Mainly for grilled cheese  which apparently takes    minutes to make   Maybe they were furiously Googling the ingredients or something   Who knows   But for some reason it took an ungodly amount of time and was last to the table   The service was also slow  mainly because as our waitress noted  they don t have trays so she couldn t carry drinks or food for   people  which resulted in multiple runs back to the kitchen and bar   Which is understandable because it TOTALLY makes sense to not have serving trays in a restaurant   I mean  how out of place would that be   Trays   In a restaurant   I can t imagine   That would be like having alcohol at a bar   Too foreign a concept   Anyway   I get it isn t the best or classiest place downtown  so I cut it

the chair stating it ll cost       because ive reached the cap on my insurance  i told them i couldn t afford it  they then purpose a payment plan im thinking wow they really want to help me  Being desperate and scared I signed this inter office agreement  the dentist per their chart  extirpated my canals  That s it  i tried to be ahead of the game and paid      toward the  treatment  But after looking around more and after talking to another dentist and insurance i decided to go to a different location where the complete treatment would be half the price and same quality  better work actually  the front desk at the new location treats me with respect and doesn t make me feel like I m scum  Bethany dental front desk staff didn t help at all with the situation  after numerous contacts explaining ive done a root canal elsewhere they have billed me for nearly      for a supposed root canal  it would of been more if i hadn t blocked them from my bank  i actually received an email from them stating  we accessed the pulp chamber and cleaned the canals which is a root canal  I m not stupid Google exists and honey a root canals consists of way more steps then just cleaning the roots  If all the dentist did was extirpate my canals then bill me for that  nothing else   Before doing any kind of expensive procedure at Bethany Dental  don t me like me and rush into it  take an extra day and look elsewhere other wise they ll keep billing you for something they never even completed at outrageous costs ',\n 'Might be helpful if you were looking to buy  but if you need help with something you currently have then good luck getting any help or response   I walked into this place around     p on a Tuesday and there are seven workers sitting around and no customers in the

was willing to pay the deductible   Some guy named Chauncey looked annoyed to have to help  which he didn t help at all so I don t know why he was annoyed    Immediately thought of everything they could say to get rid of me   I purchased at a third party store  not a corporate store  had no clue of this myself   I could pay      and cancel the contract if I didn t like it  I could buy a knew one   Now I know why everyone hates Sprint  they don t care about their customers   Then some other worker wanders over and says   you know it can crack if you carry it in your pocket  and walked off

Every single dish  I ordered the mofongo de camarones  shrimp with mashed plantain   The shrimp came separate  and the garlic sauce lacked any flavor   it didn t even taste like garlic  The sauce that typically comes with this dish  in a separate cup  looked and tasted like oil  So gross   I would never eat here again ',\n 'Will not be back    The service was just awful  We used a Scoutmob and they tried to act like we could not use it by saying they no longer accept it  However  I quickly let them know that the Scoutmob for this location was recently added  So  they decided to take it grudgingly  The food was only decent  The location is in some shady strip mall  The value was just okay  When we were about to pay  the server handed us a bill and I reminded her that we were using the     off Scoutmob deal  so she took the bill back and came back with another that was pretty much the same except    difference   REALLY    She added the     tax but also a so called Scoutmob fee   RIDICULOUS    ',\n 'I ve been to this location twice and couldn t be more disappointed  I looked through my provider list and saw this dermatologist listed so I called up for an appointment  When I arrived  I was told that I would be seeing Stephanie Delaney  Not the doctor  but the physician s assistant  Huh  Ok  Thought I booked an appointment with a doctor     Stephanie was very pleasant and listened to all my concerns  She suggested a round of medication to help with acne and I went on my way with my prescription  And a     co pay for not seeing an actual doctor  Hmm    Took several months of the medication and saw no difference  I call the office to see if I can up the dosage  which she suggested was the next step if the initial dose wasn t effective  and I was told I need to book an appointment  Oh  I see  I get medication that doesn t work and have to come in and pay yet another co pay just to have the dosage changed  as was suggested the first time   And it s not like they had to test my blood or anything to make sure levels were okay  I literally sat down  said nope no changes  and got a new prescription   Time to find a new dermatologist ',\n 'This place is only worth your time if you are looking for discount designer jeans  My advice to anyone selling anything  try eBay or even donate  If this store actually does accept your used clothes purses  which is an

try to sell something to them  give yourself an afternoon because they are highly unorganized and very slow ',\n 'We were seated immediately but unfortunately in the front booth in the bar  I am sure others may find this a good spot but we did not  It was so loud from the children in the waiting area   the bartenders behind the bar talking at an extremely high level  the waitstaff grabbing sliverware while continuing to talk to those back at the podium  and other waitstaff conversation   including a high five session   We could not hear or have our own conversation   The food  Well it is what it is  whoch is why I don t regularly go to the OG and don t expect too much  they didn t improve on my opinion  We ordered two never ending bowl  one with chicken  highly over priced at      Had two refills   On all dishes there was very little sauce   The new Mushroom sauce had no flavor and   small mushroom pieces  nothing like the advertisements   On the second refill with chicken  the chicken had clearly been placed on another plate  one with red sauce  removed and placed  red sauce and all  on to the bowl with white sauce ',\n 'I just had a terrible experience here at the Shaking Crab in Quincy   The server brought us our crab and told us that the crackers were in the washer and would be out in a minute or two  Then    minutes passed  still no utensils  we asked again and a different server told us that they didn t have any more  that they kept going missing  This went on for the rest of the time we were here  After    minutes of having our food the   of us were given one cracker  The crab was ice cold  The staff then avoided our table   We informed the manager and he did not seem to care  I normally would never post anything like this  but that was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant   I would give them a negative star if I could  The food was NOT worth the money it cost us ',\n 'We asked them about adding the gooey half boiled eggs that you d be able to get at any other ramen place   and they only serve hard boiled eggs  This just seemed extremely weird to us and as owners of a ramen shop I would highly recommend they add that to their

It was the most disappointing experiance     That f ing place does not even know what is indo Chinese   they even justified it is indo Chinese      Pls avoid this place     the server was an a Hole who was suggesting all crap    ',\n 'The wireless is spotty to the point of being useless   It was very difficult to even get this review posted  much less do a meaningful work related task using the internet   I do not recommend staying here if you depend on a reliable internet connection   Staff state it is a free service so it should not matter if it works or does not work  and there will be no further effort to fix this ongoing issue   The quality of the food for breakfast was slightly below that of a school cafeteria   The waiter was surprisingly inattentive given that there was only one other table to serve  at minimum I expect a single glass of water    It takes about     minutes to enter the room due to the quirky key card system  one must insert and remove the card timed perfectly or the lock faults and the process need to be retried   In spite of the above  the beds were comfortable ',\n 'I went to do my usual grocery shopping this evening got done collecting my items starting working my way to the registers  once I get close enough I notice there is only   register open for all items    registers open for    items or less and   registers open for self service  My main issue is once I notice the line for the regular register ended close to where the self service lines were and several black shirts standing around not doing anything about it  Me along with several other customers had to ring and bag our own groceries which I have no issue with if that was the amount of items I had to be at that register  But to ring be made to stop because the line is full of your groceries and now you have to go and bag with   at that time black shirts standing in the area seeing clearly assistance was needed  I felt worst for the elderly woman with her handicap child in a wheelchair doing her best to handle everything  At the end of the day there are several people in this world looking for work and can t find it while we have people like the ones I encountered today with positions they are clearly abusing  This place truly needs a reface of their front workers I can t say the whole store but definitely the front workers ',\n 'I love massages  good massages that is  And a good massage requires a good therapist who listens to their clients  Which  unfortunately for me did not happen    I think the worst part of a bad massage is that you re all too keenly aware of that bad massage for every minute your are paying for  And you re literally counting down the minutes until it ends  which is completely counterproductive to your reason for getting the massage in the first place  I tried the introductory massage for NINETY minutes  Had this been a good massage  I would have been happy  I would have been ecstatic  But within minutes of my    minute massage commencing I knew it was going to be a bad massage  I had filled out a questionnaire prior to my massage session in which I Circled target problem areas that I wanted to have addressed  particularly my neck  shoulders  and upper back  When I met my therapist  he read my form and confirmed these specific areas with me  But the bulk of my ninety minute massage was not targeted at the three areas I had requested  Instead  my therapist decided to give me the massage HE wanted to give  During my session  I repeatedly requested that he cover these areas in lieu of the other areas he focused on  mainly my arms  hands  legs  and feet  This was a very looonnnggg massage   which usually is a good thing  but in this case just proved to be frustrating  I couldn t wait for it to be over  I literally ran out of the room when he said it was over  When the lady at the front desk started talking to me about memberships I was not interested in being here for one more minute   On a side note regarding employment  My dear friend worked here in sales for a brief stint which is why I tried the place in the first place  He endured an injury on the job and could not walk or stand as a result of the injury  which made performing his job duties here impossible  Short story shorter   they fired him  refused to communicate with him  and never paid him his last check   This place has a VERY high turnover rate  which speaks for itself  They literally have employment ads on Craigslist every day  ',\n 'For electricity bill mishap  It might be National Grid or fire department s mistake but we were renting the apt from Riversedge and it was property manager s responsibility to inform us rather than pushing us away and acting ignorant   I agree you can charge us for repairing the wall if it was mentioned in the lease   which was not  Also  we asked property manager before we drilled those holes and he never once mentioned that it should be  nail size  or we will be charged for the repair  As a matter of fact  lease says that riversedge maintainence willl remove the toggle bolts   do nails need toggle bolts   These costs are minor compared to the rent we paid and as I mentioned before it s not a deal breaker but it should have been mentioned in the lease or clearly told before hand  No one like such surprises   Thanks for offering to reimburse but not needed  Its the inconvenience       Lastly  As I mentioned in my previous post   Its a nice apartment but not proper support from staff ',\n 'The food has always been good  always  The service on he other hand has always always been bad  The waiters always leave you hanging  the owner is rude and  sad to say  ghetto in front of customers  Again  the food is spot on but the service is horrible  I have been coming here for years and it never changes  We are here today  the first time in a couple months and they have renovated  They have expanded into the unit next door  Good renovation  bigger space  better decor  Still a ways to go before it is finished but good  Wish the service was better  unfortunately I doubt I will return  I think today was it ',\n 'This is my first yelp review because I have never felt this strongly about a business before    Regarding reliability and customer service  this is hands down the worst company I have ever dealt with     Their cleaning employees are nice people  but awfully unprofessional and with absolutely no training   They are basically just told to show up  There are no standards by which they must adhere  even in regards to what supplies they bring      The last cleaner I had brought a single rag with stains and hair on it  to clean everything  even the bathroom   and no paper towels  I opted to give her my counter cloths to use for the kitchen at least  but couldn t find it after she left   so I guess she took it with her     Since she presumably used the same rag in the toilet as everywhere else    I had to clean AGAIN after she left    The WORST part is the customer service and overall company interaction     First cleaning    I booked using a referral promo    I have the screenshot of what I was supposed to be charged   when I made the booking  However the charge on my credit card was DOUBLE     Customer service said the quoted price was due to an error in their website design and thanked me for bringing in to their attention  but did not refund me the balance    The cleaning was just ok  but I opted to give it another try  BIG MISTAKE     The second cleaning   I had a scheduling conflict and moved the cleaning by   hours  the online system confirmed that I would be charged a     fee   However  the schedule change did not take effect  they showed up when I was not home  and my whole payment was wasted     Customer service told me  nothing was rescheduled    they don t know why the system did not register it  no compensation offered   The  rd cleaning  The pro  Omar  started by texting that he was running late   Then he texted that he could not come due to police activity in the T and HIS WORDS    the situation is a lil risky for me      I called customer service and they confirmed that he would not be coming   They told me they would refund my credit card the full amount paid for the cleaning and also issue me a     goodwill credit since my whole afternoon was wasted waiting for him       The credit card refund never showed up  and when I called   weeks later  customer service told me that they just gave me a goodwill credit because the pro  was late     I told them that in fact he NEVER showed up   I have his messages to prove it  and I HAD been told I was going to get the full refund to my credit card       They refused to refund the full amount  I asked them if they have customer service calls recorded  so that they can go back to Sep    and listen to what I was told   The woman told me that her manager said yes they have the calls recorded  but he will not listen to them  and that she was  proceeding to cancel this call    AND SHE HUNG UP ON ME     Needless to say I will NEVER refer anyone to Handy   I have never in my life dealt with such disrespectful and terrible customer service     The concept is great  their cleaners are nice but somewhat unprofessional  but the company values are extremely sketchy     Bottom line  Handy is a scam  a huge waste of money AND time ',\n 'Just had a shellac mani pedi  I m usually pretty fair in the sense that I expect to get what I pay for  And since this is one of the lower priced nail salons in the area  I didn t come in with extremely high expectations  But even with my modest expectations  I was seriously disappointed with this place  The tools used for my pedicure and manicure looked overused and unsanitary  the women in the salon carried on a conversation at the top of their lungs the entire time I was there  and my nails were unevenly shaped  I will definitely be finding another salon in the area ',\n 'The worst Chinese restaurant I have ever been to in vancouver  The the shreaded pork had no mushrooms and is full of Msg  The lions head was full of corn starch  The fish was not fresh  We have to wait    minutes for dessert which we eventually cancelled thee order  You can be blind folded and bump into a better Chinese restaurant in Vancouver  Service was slow with an attitude   The chef managed to screw up every dish we ordered  I was angry and said I would write them up on yelp  The response is their loyal chinese customers do not use yelp  wt     ',\n 'An open letter to Kreuger Farms   Dear Mr  Kreuger   I have been a loyal customer for over    years   I have had many memorable times coming to your farm to pick fruits  pumpkins and feast on the goodies sold in your market  I expected the same experience today  but sadly  was greatly mistaken    I came to pick raspberries  but because it was raining  was in the market area waiting for the rain to subside  While I was contemplating buying a flat  one of your employees brought over a sign that raised the price of the flats and stuck it on the cart  When I remarked about the price  she flippantly said that I was too slow and should have gotten it sooner   I saw you come over and was about to make a comment  when you interrupted me and said   that s what supply and demand is   And walked away   I would like to believe that you and your staff were just having a bad day and that customers usually are usually treated with better customer service instead of being subjected to the blatant price hikes and rude comments I experienced today   Your  lesson  in supply and demand was taken to heart  And I m sorry to say that I will never be coming back to support your market again  Also  I will encourage my friends and colleagues who are looking for farm fresh produce and fruits to consider alternative more customer friendly establishments    I know my change in patronage will not impact your bottom line at all  but I would encourage you to think about what true customer service means and practice that with your other patrons  before the demand for your goods drops due to how you treat your customers   Sincerely  Former Kreuger farms fan',\n 'I had been coming here for years  but Habana s has lost it ways  The food was so bad and expensive   Bad food that cost a lot leaves you feeling more than a little ripped off   The drink menu does not have prices   this is because a glass of wine is    dollars   The     Lechon Asado could have been mistaken for bad jerky    There are NOW much better Cuban here in Austin  let this one fade away ',\n 'Just the worst  Always takes several days to get your meds  Staff is not helpful  Tell you to request refills using the Walmart app and it NEVER works  Ugh  Wish this wasn t the closest pharmacy to where I live ',\n 'Apparently it s a requirement to have a TERRIBLE attitude to work here  Just moved in across the street and was excited to have a juice bar across so close  Went in the first day to be  greeted  by a young woman with the worst attitude ever  I felt like I was doing her a disservice by asking her to do her job  Went in the day after hoping she wouldn t be working because the food was quite good  only to find another young woman with an equally if not worse attitude working  Whoever owns or runs this establishment needs to find people who don t suck life out of the room to represent their business  I would rather pay someone to go and get me a smoothie than go in myself ',\n 'Absolutely overpriced for the value  I wanted to support a small business but we got absolutely ripped off       to fix a leak in an outdoor  below the ground pipe  I don t think he understands the basics of business  a business thrives by adding value  And doing so repeatedly  Not by overcharging customers   I even tried to explain this to him but to avail    We will never use this business again ',\n 'Did not enjoy this place at all  The Milky Sake wasn t good  The broth for the beef udon was very bland and the Miso soup was cold  The Japanese fried chicken was flavorful but that s about it ',\n 'Usually have very good experiance at joes  but my friend s turkey burger was wrong and undercooked  pink    times  Unacceptable in my eyes  and I wont be back at let to this location ',\n 'Granted it was Friday but the wait to get drinks and food was unacceptable  We got seated quickly but even getting waitress to come by was difficult  Had two hungry kids waiting  Messed up drink order  And messed up food order  Staff may be overworked and our waitress in particular did not seem well versed in the menu    As far as food is concerned  Cheese enchiladas tasted like kraft American cheese slices  Veggie changa was too breadth and didn t have much flavor  Chips were ok  Margaritas were way too sweet    Would not go again ',\n 'We received terrible service when we ordered at Sweet Mamas today  We told the server we were on lunch break and we come from a company that is right down the road that always orders there so they usually work well with us and get us in and out in a timely manner    but not today  They were incredibly rude and put our order in late  like    minutes after we ordered  Then we asked where our food was and that we needed to leave soon  and the waitress said  well if you need to leave you need to leave  I will get to go boxes   We were in shock  We asked for the owners and they weren t in  so we ffigure that s why the staff was so terrible today  but my group and I decided to never go back there  So if you go and are served by a young girl that dresses like she s going to a soccer match  run the other direction and eat somewhere else  We ended up taking our food in TO GO boxes and ate at work  Now we re telling our whole company of over       employees to stay away from it ',\n 'I usually go into places like chilis with pretty low expectations  I worked at a chilis for many years so I understand the food quality and what to expect from a place like this  I m not sure if this location is a franchise or not  but it was just horrible  From the service to the food presentation to the taste  just ew    I always order a margarita  queso dip and a quesadilla explosion salad  Being that this is always my order  I ve come to know what to expect  but this meal almost seemed like it was someone trying to replicate  unsuccessfully  the chilis  recipes  The queso dip was like warm and thick  The consistency was grainy instead of creamy and it just didn t taste good  The quesadilla salad was thrown onto the place and looked like someone had bumped the plate or almost dropped it or something  The chicken was thick and rubbery    I know this place is in tourist central so maybe they don t have to pay much attention to quality on account that people will come regardless because they won t know  but we definitely won t be back here  The chilis on I drive is much more consistent  It s a little more of a drive  but it s worth it ',\n 'First of all  let me say  I appreciate that this place exists  as Boston hasn t really caught on to the Bubble Tea craze like the West Coast where there s a shop every few miles BUT  the tea was horrible  And by horrible  I mean that it tasted powdered and the tapioca balls were completely tasteless and inedible  And by inedible  I mean that they weren t cooked properly and were gelatinous  borderline melting  I ordered a Sesame tea and my gf ordered a Thai iced tea  I see people ordering at the stand  and I just pity them  as I pitied myself for paying      for two gross teas that we immediately dumped in the trash when we turned the corner   Go to Boston Tea Stop instead  It s the same price but yummy ',\n 'Been wanting to check this place out for awhile  so I came in on a whim after lunch   The counter girl gave me the impression she wasn t happy to be there since she just stared at me without smiling when I walked in   You can t substitute veggies for rice  it s an add on  you can only get the spring rolls fried  gross    I ordered the chicken curry with veggies to go  the place is small  clean and quiet   The dish was bland  the  veggies  were   pieces of carrot and   pieces of potato   It s inexpensive  and close to my house  but I will not visit again ',\n 'I was going to leeba for over two years  I LOVED how Elie cut and colored my hair   I referred at least a dozen customers to Elie because they all loved my hair  Last March I got my third keratin treatment in two years  I paid       The week before that I had gotten a cut  color  highlight and blow dry and bought some products  With tips  I spent close to         in two weeks  When I washed my hair a couple of days after the keratin my new highlights were brassy blonde and completely burnt and shriveled up  I had to straighten my hair but it looked terrible  I went to the salon and elie agreed to fix it  He toned down the highlights and cut my hair really short trying to cut the fried hair out but it still looked terrible  When I went back for my next cut I told him I was really upset and he assured me he was going to fix it  Not only did he not fix it  because it can t be fixed  but he charged me  The next appointment I made with him he cancelled and I had to go to somebody else because I couldn t get another appointment for weeks  So when I was getting close to needing another haircut I went into the salon and made an appointment and I told him I was upset about all the money I paid for the keratin  He said we will talk when you come in for appointment  I went in the following week for my appointment on a Monday and he had called in sick  I asked when next appointment was and they couldn t offer me anything til Friday at       I told receptionist I work til  pm and could be there at      and she said sorry  he is booked  I have tried to contact the owner twice via their website but haven t heard a word from them     hmmmm    I know they have my number because they have called to cancel twice  Unfortunately second time I didn t get message til after I went to salon  I am so hurt and disappointed by how I was treated by Elie  And I was totally ripped off ',\n 'Note to the Yelp admin  this place actually closes at      pm  not   pm  Weird  I know  but I went to get an iced coffee on another hot Boston day and when I arrived at      I waited  I waited a few minutes before someone came over and told me it was closed  Still before   pm  Thankfully there s a Starbucks coming in soon across the street so we don t have to settle when we want an afternoon iced coffee ',\n 'This pharmacy has a terrible customer service  We need to wait    minutes for a single prescription drug  There are only   people behind us  None of

'I decided to take my laptop to MacTronics based on a friends recommendation   The issue with my Macbook Pro  My screen kept freezing and finally after two weeks it just stopped booting up   Normally this would be a sensible conclusion that my hard drive was fried   However  I installed an SSD a few years ago and those things rarely crash   So I took it to MacTronics and explained that I wasn t sure what was wrong with the laptop but I assumed it was the hard drive even though it was SSD   I was informed for them to run an diagnostics test on the laptop it would cost me    bucks   If that came up with nothing they would need to open the laptop up that would be an additional    bucks   I received a call two days later and I was politely told that they couldn t find out what was wrong with my laptop but they assumed it was the hard drive   Which is what I assumed before I dropped my laptop off   They also told me that I was    bucks in so far and that the next step was to erase my hard drive and reformat it to see if it was actually the hard drive   The next step would cost me an additional    bucks bringing my total to     bucks   When I asked if erasing my data was necessary they told me yes in order to keep troubleshooting   I refused because I know that I can erase my own data  go to the Apple store and they can reformat my hard drive for free   So I picked up my laptop  paid    bucks  and went to the Apple store   First off  Apple ran two different diagnostics tests FOR FREE     They also told me that because I installed my own hard drive that the diagnostics test will always show my hard drive as an error so they were looking for other errors   They also agreed that SSD hard drives rarely crash so they wanted to take a look inside my Macbook Pro overnight FREE of charge   I got a call the next day from Apple saying my laptop was fixed by merely replacing the cable that connects the hard drive to the motherboard   Data Saved   And it cost me    bucks    If you have an Apple device that is less than   years old DO NOT TAKE IT TO THIS PLACE unless you need data recovery ',\n '   I would like to make it clear that I did not visit the office  so I am not commenting on the dentist s skills care     This comment is about the front desk staff   I was very excited about their Groupon deal  So I called to schedule an appointment  telling them that I was using the Groupon  It was pretty difficult to make an appointment because I got one for two weeks later  and her attitude was not so pleasant  Then  she said she would email me a registration package soon  But I did not receive it until three days before the appointment  So I completed it and sent it back immediately  Later  she did not remind me about the appointment again  I had a very bad day before the appointment  so unfortunately I forgot about it   When I called to reschedule  I apologized several times  and her attitude was still not so pleasant  She said   You cannot reschedule until you pay us the     cancellation fee  It says that on the website  I don t know where  but you can go find it   You don t know where   Because you never told me possibly anyone about it       was even more expensive than the Groupon deal I paid for   So I said   When there is a cancellation policy  my dentists and doctors always call me to remind me the day before the appointment   She said   Well  we do it two days before   No  she did not do that either  So I found another dentist  They told me about their cancellation policy the first time I called  Then  they called me to remind me two days before the appointment and two hours before the appointment     Maybe being more responsible and courteous like the other dentist s staff would not have turned away your customer ',\n 'Aweful Aweful Aweful service       Rude hostess  she was dismissive and didn t care for our business so we went elsewhere  Band sound great while I was there waiting on hostess for short period  ',\n 'I do not recommend this place at all when we ate my grandfather after halfway through eating his meal found a cockroach in his food  no joke   Then we still had to pay for it  Just when you thought it couldn t get any worse their prices were different on the bill then when it said on the menu  Overall if you read this far it was pretty bad ',\n 'This is a nice place to throw a party for a small child  So nice  in fact  that after attending two parties here I decide this was the place where I would host my son s first birthday    My issue is with their customer service   I ve been trying to book a date for three weeks now and I can t get them to give me the time of day    Initially  I called to gather info about the party packages  I gave the woman on the phone my email address  phone number  and preferred dates and she promised to email me once she checked her book and found availability   A week later  not having heard back  I went on their website to book the date on my own  Unfortunately the link was broken so no go  Then I called back to book it on the phone and got voice mail  Left a message  A day later  still no call back    Maybe they are just so busy that losing a new customer is of no concern  Doesn t seem like a sustainable business model to me ',\n 'We were having a family gathering pn September         and decided to order some sushi  We called the order in at   pm  so we could have it ready for pick up at  pm  We arrived at  pm and the employees told us the order wasn t ready  Then they said that they were busy and had a lot of large orders  I have to say my Family has been in the restaurant business for    years and if we ever treated customers like this  we would have never survived  FYI  THE REASON WE ORDERED THE FOOD SO EARLY IN THE DAY  WAS SO WE WOULDN T HAVE TO WAIT WHEN ALL THE ORDERS WERE COMING IN FOR THE DINNER RUSH  Very bad customer service  I won t be returning ',\n 'A vendor brought Qdoba to a meeting in our conference room  I have a meeting in there later this afternoon and thought I d call to find out when they were picking up their catering supplies  The guy said I ll call you back tomorrow and I told him I have a meeting this afternoon and just wanted to know when they were coming back for their items  He said  hold on  and that was    minutes ago  I still waiting on my headset  but although I can hear him talking to people in the background he won t get back on the phone with me   I am someone who frequently utilizes caterers for large functions at work  This lack of respect for a potential customer has lost them quite a bit of business since people were saying they liked their food and we should use them  I ll let everyone know that will not be the case  And I ll let other coordinators here know my experience so they don t make the mistake of using them either ',\n 'Scheduled a delivery for   PM  An hour later  after calling to make sure the drive is on their way  they tell me that the delivery man tried delivering our order and wasn t able to because the person who answered didn t order the food  To which I argued that no one came to our door  no one rang the doorbell or called my cellphone  WHICH THEY HAVE ON FILE FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE  to deliver the food I had ordered two hours ago  Also OBVIOUSLY if the person rejects the order  YOU RE AT THE WRONG ADDRESS  The sales representative then changes her story and says the delivery man knocked on the door and no one answered at all  This is the second time this location has completely messed something up and the fact that there was no retribution for their mistake is astounding to me  Awful customer service  not worth a single ounce of effort  Also  use a new delivery service because a delivery man who can t do his ONE SINGLE job is absolutely useless  You have forever ruined wings and Brookline  DISHONOR ON YOU  DISHONOR ON YOUR COW  DISHONOR ON YOUR WHOLE FAMILY ',\n 'These cupcakes are TERRIBLE    I ve been to both the Chestnut Hill and now the Cambridge locations and both suffer from lack of freshness and a very artificial taste     Most recently  I got a   pack of cupcakes to go at the Cambridge location which cost me a total of         about       each    When I got home  I realized cupcake carrier they use is not sufficient   the cupcakes are so tiny that they shifted around in the box and made a little bit of a mess  see photo    The cupcakes weren t for any special presentation  just to satisfy my late night sweet tooth  so I didn t mind their appearance    But I can not tolerate the staleness of the cupcakes and their very artificial taste   not when I m paying       each for a cupcake about an inch and     in diameter    I had a pink lemonade  rootbeer float  and a blueberry pie   ALL TERRIBLE TASTING    I don t even want the other   I purchased so they are going in the trash     The best cupcakes in Boston area is by far Georgetown cupcakes    Their store traffic is so high you never run into staleness   Their cupcakes also just have a rich quality with out tasing too artificial     Save your money and avoid Sweet Bakery  ',\n 'We all have one thing in common  we re all in the market for a car and want to find what fits our needs and budgets best  I heard Beaverton Toyota was the best place in Oregon to purchase a new car  Only half true  My partner and I walked inside and asked for assistance near the Toyota Corolla section and said someone would be out to meet us shortly  We stood by the car of our choice for    minutes in the pouring rain and no one came  There was another salesman helping someone and we asked him if he could send someone to help us  Another    minutes pass and no one shows up  I call the dealership and the receptionist was very kind and apologized many times and someone was out within  min  I told the salesman I wasnt looking to buy today and that I wanted to look at my options  We took the car I wanted for a test drive and I absolutely loved it  The car felt planted  even on wet surfaces  The route the salesman took us on had l sorts of turns and speeds to get a feel of the car  We went inside and took down my information  He asked if I wanted to buy the car today  I repeated myself and told him I was only looking for today  He started getting aggressive and intimidating about making the sales  He kept disappapearing every couple minutes  even while we were talking   Broadway Toyota may have a state of the art facility and greatest selection  but their service is absolutely terrible and not worth buying my car

Portland so I thought I would use   star       which should be renamed   star  This is hands down the worst dry cleaning service I have ever used  With zero customer service skills  poor cleaning

by far the worst timeshare experience  HORRIBLE customer service  we actually had some employees snap at us  We got snapped at by front desk because our plane was late so he wasn t sure if we could get booked into the room that we already paid for  Then scolded by the woman finishing up our reservation the next day  The dryer didnt work  I complained   was told that it just doesnt work well

worst  I actually was in tears during our vacation because of Westgate employees   the condo ',\n 'I m confused at how this place has any stars   The food is not what we expected at all  It was dry tasteless and completely unappetizing  The I got two tacos  I cant even remember which ones  but one had this weird mayonnaise based sauce  the fish was hard  the cajun fries were very salty and came with some orange mayo like sauce   the kids chicken tenders were hard as rocks and looked like the once you can get in the frozen section at Walmart  the shrimp appetizer was hard as rocks and swimming in some runny sauce  just completely unedible  I mean when our little ones don t want to eat the food  we know its bad    The place was just disgusting  the tables were dirty and the floors were sticky  Yuck  We will never come back to thus place  We spent about     and left hungry  NEVER AGAIN',\n 'I was looking forward to shopping at Sprouts   It opened a few weeks ago and I finally got there today   To say I was disappointed is an understatement   The staff is not just passive  but unpleasant  More than once while I was shopping a staffer whisked by me without so much as an  excuse me    They had carts of merchandise stacked up  waiting to be shelved  blocking shoppers  The cashier situation was the worst  A customer in front of me had a return credit and it took FOREVER for the required manager to complete the transaction   I brought my own bags and bagged myself  as I prefer  but when all my items were rung up  the cashier grabbed the remaining items and began to bag them in their bags instead of helping me finish with my bags   But the topper of the whole visit was that the cashier said nothing  No  thank you   no  do you need a hand   not even the now common  there you go      The place just opened  Haven t they trained the staff any customer service skills  I won t be going back     And  the prices are not that great   They have fake specials     pound packages of strawberries     for    but a   pound package for        Similar with blueberries   And many empty produce bag dispensers   Management needs to wake up ',\n 'Wow    honestly this place sucked from the time we walked in     The host greeted us  not by saying  welcome to BJs   but by asking if we had a rewards card  We said no so she told us to wait off to the side  After a very few uncomfortable moments of silence  another host motioned for us to follow him    The place was nice inside  Whatever  looked like every other bar restaurant that seems to be popular nowadays  Waitress showed up promptly  asked us what we wanted  so we got drinks and calamari appetizer  The picture on the menu  hah  I know  pictures on a menu  looked pretty good  The menu was huge  I m not joking  the burgers were broken down into categories based on which piece of equipment you wanted it cooked on   not necessarily a bad thing   but strange  Everything served here is frozen food that could be prepared at home   Well  when we got that calamari   it looked nothing like the photo  It was      but probably had three or four bites of calamari  It was a very  very small plate of food    I never send back food  I work in a kitchen and I know how annoying that can be  But   this wasn t right  My wife asked if this was a normal portion  apparently it was  I told her we didn t want it      is quite a bit of mula for a measly portion of food    Instead  we just ordered some food to try and hurry this trip up  We were both pretty ready to get out of there  but we were also hungry  Sadly  I think our calamari  which say on our table for awhile  was served to another table  Gross   Anyways  we get our food and it s not horrible  I had the jalapeño burger  which came with fried jalapeños  The burger had only a couple of jalapeños  but two different sauces   kinda weird but whatever  The Asian salad was alright as well  I guess the mandarin oranges and sesame seeds made it Asian    Whatever  this place just didn t do it for me  The staff was bad  the food was alright and the best part of our experience was leaving the restaurant ',\n 'The hotel is nice and comfortable  but the billing department is terrible  I needed an itemized receipt to be reimbursed by my job and I left the billing department   messages over the course of   weeks after they billed my card a week late for charges that I did not know that I would be billed for   I had to involve Starwood AND call and speak with the general manager before the billing department would send me an itemized bill  It was so frustrating    if you stay here  get a copy of EVERYTHING before you leave because clearly they don t know ',\n 'I can t knock the food  because it s pretty good albeit overpriced  The whole host waiting seating situation there is ridiculous  I get that you want the  entire party  to be there before seating would be diners  but you don t need to be a complete a   about it   I had a party of    waiting on   more people  we knew we would have to wait to be seated but the host seemed like he would seat our partial party if we came back in a few minutes once the table was cleared   It was freezing and pouring that day and we didn t want to be one of the many annoying people that crowd the entry  so we hung out outside  About    minutes passed and our youngest diner      went into the door to see if we could possibly sit  As SOON as the kid went in through the door  the host freaked out and told him to go back outside   I thought that this was an extremely inappropriate way to talk to anyone  We were bringing in a party of   to drop at least      on breakfast  We left and got breakfast at Acme Cafe  and banned Medina in the process ',\n 'Is there an option for no stars   I am a university student  obviously  and I eat here quite often  I commute     hours and sometimes I forget to pack a lunch    so Subway is always the best bet  Sometimes I get the footlong and eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner  It s actually quite perfect   The reason why I wouldn t even give this place any stars is because of the customer service  Wow  I ve had never been to a place with such terrible service  I mean  I m not expecting full fledged  strenuous service or anything  but I mean  can I get at least a smile    I would order my sandwich  and they would already be choosing my bread for me  I once asked for turkey and she scooped up tuna and smeared it on my bread  I wasn t paying attention because the other ladies were being terribly rude to a customer ahead of me and I couldn t help but watch in disgust   I corrected her and she looked at me  scoffed  rolled her eyes and tossed the tuna sandwich in the trash like it was bacteria infested  SO dramatic  Another occasion  I ordered a ham sandwich and I wanted it toasted    but after her putting the ham  the cheese  she added lettuce without my saying  I told her I wanted it toasted and she said   too late   I have umpteen many affairs with them  but the general point is the service is terrible  They are slow  rude and do NOT listen  It s awfully frustrating when the Subway is known for their  personalized sandwiches  and you get the complete opposite   And they don t close the sandwich when they re done with it  instead  they just wrap it up  You know what that means  right  The sauce of your choice isn t in the sandwich  it s in the paper  Ayyyya ',\n 'I ve never taken to social media to review before now  The Salem  MA location has terrible customer service  I m livid with my treatment  A few days ago  my order was over an hour late  arrived cold and the driver forgot the receipt  For my trouble   I was told that my next order would be free  I just phoned to take them up on that  and I was told there was no credit in their system for me  I am too failed by this location  TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE  Support a local mom and pop pizza place before getting mistreated by big business  SHAME ON YOU ASHLEY  Your mismanagement of my situation was deplorable  A free side order  Not good enough  I m a disabled   housebound woman and just lost a source of a meal today  I ve never experienced such deplorable service from Domino s  I ve been a loyal customer for over    years from Florida to North Carolina to New York to Massachusetts   I ll never do business with you again  I m writing corporate as well  I don t taken being mistreated well  It s unacceptable ',\n 'Don t waste your money or time with this place  I been a member since        at the Hillsboro location and had amazing Brenda work on my facials  I relocated to Portland and found  Nicole  despite all the horrible reviews about this place  I decided to open a new a membership   I needed to relax and get a facial due to long hours working in a federal building    hours   so I scheduled an appointment and didn t get Nicole  I booked on the same day with a diff person   I went in excited  however this time not even minutes of my facial  the lady grabbed a hot towel and rubbed the make up off my skin so I stopped the facial and my face was burning   she was not gentle at all and my face turned red and she popped a zit with the towel while she was removing the cleansing solution  After I went and talked with two  receptionist about the incident   I was not given the number to their manager   while I was explaining the situation my face was burning and it felt like rug burn  all over my chin  cheeks   jaw line  upper lip  and forehead  Come on  Really  why would anyone use so much strength on a facial     And these people are supposed to be TRAINED AND CERTIFIED  I ve never had problems with Dermalogica products  I m not coming back  As I m writing this post my face is still burning   I went in at      pm and it s now       and I m holding ice to my face because it feels like sun burn  Update  received a call from from the Lead she was helpful and left some items for me to pick up to fix the problem  I called the manager Darcy wanting to follow up with her as well and she had left me a voice message   She was understanding at first and as soon as I told her I wanted to cancel my membership   instead of receiving CUSTOMER SERVICE  she had the audacity to remind me of a time I paid using my  boyfriends credit card   wow I m so disgusted with this place   so irrelevant and uneducated response  DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY here ',\n 'Will never go back to any toys r us  I m not sure how this this location is still in business  Every time I shop here I leave wishing I never walked in  The store is a mess  cluttered  and I can never find what I am looking for  Today after an hour of shopping I finally found an item for my friends son s birthday  The item was labeled        on tje shelf  When I checked out my bill was         Money is not the option  however  when I told the cashier that the price was wrong she asked me if I would like to return the product  I said no  and walked her to the shelf  where   more of the same item sat  While she checked on the correct price the line became   customers long  Only one checker was helping customers  At a desk on the side of the store  sat the general manager  So I left the register and spoke with the gm Cornelius  I told him that the price was wrong and that every time I shopped here I left disappointed  He said that a customer probably moved the product on the shelf   I told him that there was more of the same product in the same location  He did not want to help me nor did he care to ask about the past experiences that I had in the store  This place suxs the life out of you ',\n 'Extremely unprofessional  I came in to upgrade my phone  They did not have the phone I wanted even though it is one of the most popular phones  They said they would have to get it from another store  The employees left me sitting there for over    minutes while they joked back and forth with each other  Supposedly they were doing something with my account but did not communicate with me at all  They could not locate my account even though I have a Fido number and online account  I finally left the store as parking was expiring  Go to a real Fido store as previous reviewer suggests ',\n 'Kinda a pretentious strange dive bar  Full of lots of office jocks  and scantly clad plastic looking  women  good beer selection  good happy hour  terrible terrible food   Please do yourself a favor a skip eating here  Wings were just bones no meat at all  Seems like they were over fried and re fried  Slow cooked chicken was just Safeway roasted chicken with some day old bread toasted  In no way what so ever worth      a complete waste of money  no quality check    Server was running around like a mad person  not really doing anything  then she would disappear for   min at a time   I m not really sure what was going on with her  Then she was pissy when when we were ordering from the bar   Decent live music a bit to loud for the time  Emptied pretty quick once the musician started  He was good just to loud ',\n 'Went there this morning expecting good things  Terrible under cooked food twice we sent it back   not a good experience   We ordered Ham and got some space age meat like substance  Never again ',\n 'Came by today and it was closed  Hope she goes out of business because she is bad for the other black businesses in the community  All she does is try and get other black businesses in the area closed instead of capitalizing off of it   She is a low down evil miserable individual ',\n 'I went here some time back and did not find much  resistance  to anything Establishment by the main guy here    In fact  I found the views about the US made  drug war  in Colombia seemed almost to parallel that of the US government      It really was totally disappointing      The place definitely is not the center of any sort of  rebellion  political resistance that I could see ',\n 'Awful service   slow    couldn t get refills like asked   feel we were ignored  Won t go back to this location   Garlic butter fries were dry',\n 'This place was not worth it  the tortillas were paper like and hard to pull apart  the crispy taco shells were out of a box  There was no flavor  lots of reviews keep referring to price but if its not worth eating its not worth buying ',\n 'We made reservations over a week ago for a special occasion  we had heard negative comments but wanted to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt  We ordered lots of appies and dinner to follow  Dinner was very bland  no taste to the food and there was a lack of quality in the meat  After dinner we ordered desert and tea  while waiting for the desert a waitress told us to leave if we weren t ordering anything else  not knowing we had actually ordered desert   Completely rude and uncalled for specially because we had made reservations a week prior  They lack the skills to run a restaurant and were not prepared for more customers  Very disappointing  will most likely not return  At the end  we went to pay the bill  they had already added   percent tip to the bill even though the service was extremely bad and they were trying to make us leave quickly so they can give the table to someone else  Be smart and read the reviews  this place is just not worth your time or money ',\n 'If I could give this place a negative star rating  I would  After my girlfriend got patted down before walking in  we sat down to have a couple of drinks at the bar  Once we got our drinks  the bartender walked around to the outside of the bar and sat down  not getting up the whole time to check and see if we needed anything  etc  I had to signal her over from across the bar to ask for our check  From there  it went further downhill   My legal name is William  but I everyone usually knows that Bill is short for or a nickname for William   like Joe for Joseph  or Bob for Robert  Dick for Richard  etc  Well  they wouldn t accept my Visa card because my license shows William and my cc shows Bill  In all my years  I have never had an issue of my card getting rejected   and I mean never   I asked to speak with the manager and offered to even call my credit card company   this guy didn t have a clue  nor did he care one bit  I then pulled out my AMEX  which did have William listed  but the bartender then stated they don t even take AMEX  After all that  I just ended up paying cash  but this was in my mind terrible customer service  The place inside leaves a lot to be desired as well    small  unclean bathroom  etc  I would not recommend this place to anyone   there are much better places to go in that same vicinity ',\n 'Over the years  I ve had a burger here before and always thought it was good   Recently  I set up a corporate outing here with over     people   The appetizers were ok  but the entrees on the buffet were lousy   Just before the dessert went out  someone pointed out a cockroach walking on the plates to me  DISGUSTING   See picture   They also  didn t receive  our first check  then they charged over    k on our credit card without authorization   We tried to sort this out  they told us to send another check and when they received it  they will credit our card   Well  they cashed the check over a month ago and still no refund to us   I will NEVER go here again and I will tell everyone I know not to as well ',\n 'Never again     Found a dead bug in a dish from the buffet   When I showed it to the staff  the response was just a sheepish grin  no apology or anything  They just don t care for the quality or health of customers ',\n 'If you like overpriced furniture and pushy sales staff  this is the place to go   I don t  so took my business elsewhere    At least they did me a favor and let me know that they were scammers up front  among other things  every item I looked at was only going to be  on sale  for a few more days  Even the items that would be custom ordered   If you re that awful before they take your money  just imagine what they re going to be like after the sale ',\n 'Super slow service   don t go here for lunch if

cheap and didn t deliver what I ordered via Teleflora  Consider me an experienced buyer who only wants the best for the people I send flowers too   I will never order from here nor Teleflora again ',\n 'After reading the reviews I have given this shop a try and after one visit I will not return  I have been a VW enthusiast for over    years  so after moving from California and having a lot of options of independent mechanics I thought Full Throttle was the perfect transition after moving to Orlando  What I found was a shop that failed to do simple work and give me bad advice  I took my Passat in there for a brake job  simple rotor and pad replacement  when I asked the service tech I can t recall his name but he s the only guy answering phones and giving  advice   told me when I break in the new pads rotors I should accelerate as fast as I can like up to    mph and brake as hard as I can  Anyone who has common knowledge sense of brakes knows this is the opposite of what you re suppose to do  I just acted like he was right  as I knew it was a bad sign  he also proceeded to give somewhat of a guilt trip for bringing in my own parts  The other thing they did was flush my transmission fluid  oddly  he said it was low when they checked it and said I should bring the car back in a week or two to recheck the fluid level  As soon as I got the car back the transmission started to jerk  which had never done before  Having owned this car for   years I knew they had either messed something up or did not put back enough AT fluid  which is why he said come back  I took it to another mechanic I trust but is further from my house  he checked the AT fluid level and said it was   quarts low  which was causing the jerking during gear shifts  He filled up the missing fluid and the problem was gone  I will never go back to Full Throttle  I can see how people would be fooled to think these guys are VW lovers and treat people who drive dubs with some type of special treatment or loyalty  and that may be the case for some  but for me  based on talking and going to many shops over two decades  these guys are just full of themselves and want to act like they are the only alternative when it comes to working on dubs  I am disappointed because I was hoping I could find a VW shop I trust  but all I got was weird attitude  bad workmanship  and bad advice  I am writing this review because I think most of the reviews on here are written by shop friends in order to drum business  And I want to give an objective review of a bad experience that i think was not an aberration  but rather more the norm  Lastly  when I brought the car to my other VW mechanic who is now worth going out of my way to see  He found a coolant leak at the rear flange where it was completely rotted away  He couldn t figure out how the guys at Full Throttle missed it  because FT also replaced a leaking valve cover gasket  so he told me they should have seen the leaking coolant   That s it  rant done ',\n 'I had been meaning to write a bad review of this place for a couple of months now  Looks like I m too late  since they are closing at the end of the month  I have never encountered a bike shop so bad that I truly wished they would cease to do business  but this place came pretty close  I came in a few times  and each time  the owner made it abundantly clear that he did not give a      that I was in his shop  On top of that  he didn t have some items that any shop should have  irrelevant now  but had no     rim strip and had just   motley saddles   I ve worked in a shop before  and customers are the lifeblood of the shop   bummer this guy didn t realize that and ran a lousy shop that went under ',\n 'I went here for a birthday  had one of my worst experiences at a restaurant  and joined Yelp just to write this review  I went with my girlfriend for dinner during mid week and found the place doing decent  though not busy  so we were at least seated promptly  Everything went downhill from there  We started with steamers and I had a large baked stuffed lobster  Both were tough and practically inedible  with the meat inside the lobster practically welded to the inside of the shell  With the waiter not showing up to deliver the food and not checking on us as my date finished her lobster roll  she approved of that at least  and I sat incredulous  I had to wait until he showed up with the check before I could get him to have the manager to come over  I explained the situation and showed the barely touched lobster to said manager  who tsked tsked sympathetically before offering to give us a free drink or desert  We went back and forth for at least   minutes before he agreed to take it off the bill  Still furious when I think about this now   Do not waste your time at this location  The one in Boston proper may be better  but I d say just go to Legal Seafood or  better yet  Atlantic Fish  both a block away from the Boston location  ',\n 'I am not a customer here  but as a healthcare worker I come here frequently as part of my job   I can say that this is one of the worst medical centers in the city  Their staff is overworked and it shows in how they interact with allied healthcare personnel and their patients  Walking into the ER feels more like walking into a room of juvenile high school students gossiping about one another and their patients    The staff is extremely rude and I can say both from first hand experience and from discussing with other health care personnel that most of the staff cares more about getting patients out of the building as quickly as possible than educating or helping people    This place is a product of profits over patients  They only want your money and want to make you a repeat customer  They run on a bare minimum staff  most of whom are  admittedly  underpaid  which may explain why they are all so unhappy  and are not able to meet the needs of Dekalb County  Several times a week the hospital is filled to capacity and they are unable to accept any more patients    Do yourself and the staff at DMC a favor  Go somewhere else ',\n 'So  line up outside the door  but plenty of clean and empty tables inside  Waltz up to the hostess to be ignored    Charming  Told    minute wait  sure thing  we ll head to a store nearby for a look and come back shortly  Again  empty tables everywhere  but still a line up out the front  Ordered food  said food was delivered to the table  Wait staff only barely able to muster up enough  customer service  to scrape by     I made the mistake of ordering the shrimp    Spent the rest of my Saturday in the bathroom throwing my insides up  Pleasant  Needless to say I will never be back  as I ve since heard other horror stories from other patrons at various other Max   Erma s   Lift your game  I don t like having a New Years long weekend destroyed by a third rate meal and then the after effects of what can only come down to poor kitchen practices  I should probably report this establishment to the appropriate authorities ',\n 'Very Bad Service       i have been using this car wash for couple years  only doing exterior and driving it my self  through out last year i have been noticing how rude people are there  but i never interacted with them  until recently when i decided it to use full service  so i gave them my car then i went to the other end waiting for  once it came out i notice it the person who is driving it can not open the door from inside  so i opened it from outside then i realized that they  broke then handler from inside  so i asked for a manager  and when he came i was trying to explain to him the situation but what shocked me is that from the beginning he was to aggressive with and he does not even want to listen to me  so i realized that this guy is no gooooood  by the way i am a regular customer so when i told him that  his answer was take your business  his argument was that things broke  and we are not responsible for them   the sad thing i called there office which is located in Malden  guess what the woman who is responsible for taking complaints is never available    i used to spent at least      every month there  Not Any More   if i could i would rate it zero star ',\n 'Wow seriously Starbucks  Get with it   Not only was the drive thru lady extremely rude on April  st at      pm but my coffee was not even full  If I wanted a half a cup of coffee do you think I would come to Starbucks   I will NOT be coming back to this location  If this was an April Fools joke some future advice    don t mess with someone s coffee    ',\n 'Not as expected  Room cleaning service not so good lots of dust   children diving   swimming in hot tub   Floats of all sizes allowed in pool  lots of kids splashing   No TV when it rains   Looked like free summer camp  Saw   women with    kids   I counted them twice   Loud disrespectful kids all over the place  Not a place to relax  The beds have the worst mattresses     nights  room cleaned one time   Maid service comes late while we were back in room   Shuttle bus to Universal   We had to take a cab ',\n 'Hate to say this but they leave the food on the warmer over heated and soggy  It s not like there s a lot of people by     pm but Christ people will be eating what they paid for  Yup that s what I had  a soggy string beans and broccoli  Yuck  Do a better job please   ',\n 'I ve had ramen from Japan to New York and places in between  The ramen was way too oily  Pretty gross  actually ',\n 'Wanted to like it  just couldn t   Seafood tasted frozen and freezer burnt   nothing was even edible   We left hungry and ate elsewhere ',\n 'Gave it a try    twice  Shame on me  Not very good BBQ  Unfortunate as I live across the street   Will not be back ',\n 'There was only one flavor of bubble tea at that time so I guess I would get it sooner than I thought  The truth is the people who ordered after me got their drinks first  and one of them ordered the same drink  The cashier  who was in charge  I assumed  didn t feel sorry when I complained  and joked with the staffs who were making the tea in Mandarin  So I talked to her again in Mandarin  repeating what I said earlier in English  and she provoked me by telling her colleagues to ease and take their time to make my bubble tea   The drink is ok  I could taste some taro in the milk tea so I could tell it wasn t just some flavored powder in it  But the service is the WORST ',\n 'Since this place is located near some decent hotels and in an okay looking strip mall  I thought I d give it a chance despite other reviews   I wouldn t expect the people I saw in here to stay in any motel other than one that rents by the hour   The food was actually pretty good   Hot and a decent selection despite the size   Number one problem is the inside   Run down  dirty carpets  a young girl sweeping right next to me as I ate   Number two  and probably the biggest reason to avoid is the clientele   The absolute dregs of humanity   If the guy talking very loudly in his phone didn t bother you  you could have picked from the idiot playing Pokémon as he went around the buffet   Oh wait  when he wasn t playing  he was definitely not disciplining his child   The little boy was screaming and yelling and he nor his wife did a thing   If you need a boost to your self esteem  come here and discover there are much more people not deserving to live on this planet   Feel good about yourself and thank the stars you aren t in this classless class of morons ',\n 'Car tint was installed by Sunbusters   Left a lot of junk dots and tint gaps  NOT air bubbles   shrink job poor on rear glass with spikes at defroster bars and dot matrix  and several large squeegee scratches and smudges in the tint from rushing the job   To top it all off  a long scratch was mysteriously left on the exterior side of door glass  which is absolutely inexcusable and very infuriating   I m perplexed how this place can receive such a high rating considering the terrible crap job done for me   I don t care if my review is an atypical anomaly of the business as the owner suggests because the poor service I received is what matters to me  not other bogus reviews   I refuse to return to this place so that they can screw the tint up even more or cause more damage out of spite   believe me  this happens more than one would think   Quality work is a lost art apparently  since it appears that a competent job can t even be achieved the first time   If you purchase a new car  appreciate quality and don t want to be severely disappointed at the tint installation ruining the complexion of the vehicle  do yourself a favor in advance and avoid this place ',\n 'The service is terrible  overpriced hookah that wasn t worth it  The owner was very unprofessional  Never would go there again  Actually looking forward to see this place shut down ',\n 'Wish I could give zero stars  this review is for the food not the service  Over priced NOT authentic vietnamese food       for a banh mi  vietnamese sandwich   seriously   hoagie bread not the usual banh mi bread and they skimp on the meat and veggie toppings  The dipping fish sauce that came with the spring rolls were salty and lack sweetness  So disappointed   The Pho  beef noodle soup  was overly spiced  my parents couldn t even finished their meals  Will not be returning and would not recommend ',\n 'Walked in and this place was beautiful staff was very  friendly  but we sat down  and in about   mins we saw a mouse crawl across the floor  The guy at the table next to us stepped on it and a waitress came over to sweeped it up  We read good reviews and we re looking forward to the place but had to leave

picked us up lunch as there isn t  alot of eateries in this area  Well  I decided to go in last week and I ordered a chicken wrap  The girl that was making it had her hair in her face  not working around food appropriote  style  I felt uncomfortable as her stringy red hair was swinging over my food  I shook it off and tried not to think of it  They only had two choices on their soda vending machine ok  they are a small business  but I figured not to complain because I understand it s a small place  I paid and left  When I got back to work I opened my wrap only to find that the tortilla was extremely burnt on the edges  I had to peel off the entire edge of the tortilla  the wrap was sloppy with stringy lettuce   YUCK   I felt so grossed out because the stringy lettuce reminded me of her hair as it was going down and I felt sick  I threw it away  I paid       for this crappy food  NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE     PS  Wish I didn t have to click on a star   NO STARS',\n 'Called a day before to go see a car   took the day off work to go see it   waited an hour for them to find the keys   to only tell me a while after the car was in the body shop getting fixed because bumper was

I get that working the door on dirty is a shitty job but you don t have to take it out on others ',\n 'I found this kiosk in the food court at Natick Mall   I thought I would give it a try   Here s how the experience went   There were   people at the counter when I arrived   One person placed an order and said she would be back   She walked away   The other person was not making a purchase   There were   young men working behind the counter   The young man at the counter engaged a conversation with the remaining non customer for about   minutes  never acknowledging I was standing in front of him   Two more people lined up behind me   I asked if I could place an order   The  front man  moves to the back and the other guy comes and says  Sure   Sorry  we re really busy    I order cheeseburger fries   The former  front man  puts a batch of already cooked fries in what appeared to be a convection or microwave convection oven for about    seconds   He takes the fries out and places them in a paper cone  shakes them up with dill flavored salt  covers them with cheese product sauce    small squirts of ketchup and one small squirt of mustard   He hands me the room temperature  hard and  previously  overcooked potatoes   I was conflicted about what to do with the fries   They were totally unappealing and tasteless  yet I paid    for them   I gave up half way through and tossed them in the trash as I left the mall   Please don t waste your money ',\n 'Had a terrible experience here tonight  so much so that I m writing my first yelp review  It started out with the bartender being extremely rude to us for no reason  He made fun of my friend s drink choice and acted like it was a chore to serve us  It was incredibly uncomfortable and unsettling  When we got seated  the waitstaff was clearly overworked and had no interest in us as customers  We got the mussels and a quarter of the shells were empty  The rest were literally the smallest mussels I ve ever eaten  Then it took    minutes for our entrees and that was only after speaking with the manager  Overall the customer experience was awful and I will never eat there or recommend there again  The food was even mediocre ',\n 'After my bad experience  the office manager called me and told me that they would not fix the carpet they messed up  despite saying they would on here and over the phone because of my yelp review  She actually said that  I m no Yelp expert  but that seems like it should be against some guideline  If I hadn t been honest about my experience on here  my carpet would have been fixed by Peace Frog    When I reminded her about the      guarantee prominently displayed on their website  she said I needed to make an appointment with another cleaner and someone from peace frog would discuss the damage with the new company  In other words  I needed to jump through a bunch of hoops and take more of my time to get them to honor their guarantee and fix the carpet that they made stink  Still  I wanted it fixed so made an appointment with a new company  And I tried calling peace frog back to tell them when the appointment with the new cleaner was  but they conveniently did not answer or return my calls   Then  the owner showed up at my house with a refund check without any warning or prior notice  I was alone with two small kids asleep in the house and having this angry guy just appear at my door  He was also upset also about my yelp review  was startling  He seemed to think the refund  while genuinely appreciated  would finish things  but they don t just advertise a refund  they say       and my carpet was still stinking  so I told him when my appointment with the new cleaner was  While standing on my doorstep  he refused to come in and look at  or more importantly smell  the damaged carpet just a few feet away    When I asked if he would pay for someone else to fix it  as the office manager suggested  he told me no  adding that if I had a problem with that answer  I could write about it on Yelp  Very clever  very unprofessional  But a helpful suggestion none the less    So now I am  My experience indicated that Peace Frog s       Peace of Mind Promise   if it actually exists  could use an Astrix by it saying something like   only if you promise to not talk about how we screwed up on Yelp   In the end  I was left worse off than when I started  having to fix a problem that didn t exist before they came to my house  The only upside is that this experience led me to another carpet cleaner in town that does reasonably priced  quality work ',\n 'BAD SERVICE  The food was gross per usual  The potatoes tasted like they were cooked in dirty  rancid oil  Everything else was just bland  AND they gave me gluten free bread  not all the bread is gluten free  without warning me that it was gluten free  I would have brought it up  but the server was too busy talking to her friend to ever come back to check in on us   The server was talking to her friend customer acquaintance the entire time even so much that she took my plate of food and threw it away without even asking if I wanted a to go box   which I wanted to take home with me  When confronted  she asked me why I didn t say anything   then apologized and offered me more eggs to take home with me  Cooking up more eggs for me to take home just didn t make sense to me  She then offered me potatoes with salsa  when I just would have preferred for them to have done the right thing and comped my meal    I had eaten only a     of my food   ALL WHILE TALKING TO HER FRIEND at another table   She was nice enough  though her behavior was extremely unprofessional   This was my sixth visit and I will not eat here ever again  It was just a waste of money  I work in

my Closet installed and they did not finish the job the day of the installation like they said they would  I had told them in advance that i would be leaving the state in a few weeks so i needed them to have my closet installed before then  They said not to worry that it would be done by the time i left  Well i am about to leave on my trip and they still have not finished the job  I have been calling them almost everyday so they can send someone to finish it but no call back in return  They charged my card with the job not being done  yet they cant call me back or send someone to finish the job  I am so dissatisfy with the company and will NEVER hire them again  This company does not cater to its customers needs and wants at all  I hope you guys wont make the mistake i made in hiring this unethical company who only care about taking your money ',\n 'I am very disgusted by what I witnessed at Hooters   Today I went to Hooters for lunch   There were at least       people of Mexican decent that walked in to be seated   I overheard a few of the waitresses talking saying they did not want to seat serve them because they felt like they probably wouldn t get a good tip because they were Mexicans   The group stood at the hostess stand for about    minutes before being seated   They were seated and sat for another    minutes and no one still had not served them  Finally a manager went to their table and at that moment one of the young ladies from the group told him that they would just go somewhere else and get something to eat   This was a blatant display of discrimination and what makes this even worse is that the waitresses that were discriminating against them were of African American decent and should be aware of the struggle and discrimination that we as black people have gone through in the past and is still going through today   It hurt my heart to see this take place as you could see that half of the group did not understand what was going on   This type of behavior should not be tolerated and Hooters need to do a better job at screening who they hire   There needs to be diversity training held at this establishment   I will be contacting corporate regarding this incident  No one should ever be treated that way no matter what color or nationality they are   ',\n 'I wish I had read the reviews of this place prior to spending my money here   I couldn t even distinguish the difference in the rolls because it all looked the same   Doesn t matter what we ordered  EVERYTHING we ordered tastes the same   It was a flavorless  bland  pasty mixture that was rolled up in dry rice and topped with fish that could have been mistaken for jerky   The avocado was more black with hints of green    The tempura was so dry it was actually chewy   This place is awful   My stomach has reached up and grabbed my tongue so as to never be assaulted in such a way again     In my opinion any positive review of this place has been purchased   Save your

makes me wonder if the spicy tuna roll I ordered had been pre made and just sitting out turning into an eraser  The Gari Gari roll was just a whole heck of a lotta cream cheese  and the Ninja roll was a disgrace to Ninjas everywhere    Aside from all of this  I m fairly certain I picked up a stomach bug here   Sorry  Ma Soba  You re a hot mess  You made me a hot mess for days after  I won t be back

something other vets have said is not necessary   My cat has already been through a major surgery   a few years back for cancer   so I don t want to put her through one again unless it was absolutely necessary   When I asked if there was a less invasive option to see if surgery even would help  she basically told me if my cat got cancer it would be my fault    Wow   I will never go back there

my friend  who is one of the most gentlemanly people I know  to step away from the car because he was being  a smart guy    not true at all   Then  he threatened to drive away  making me pay the whole        Finally we came up with     total and he skeptically counted it and drove away   These are the worst scum of the earth  they re crooked  and will do anything to make a quick buck   Be very careful if you ever have the misfortune of dealing with these troglodytes ',\n 'Hello fellow yelpers  I use yelp all the time and this is one of only two times when I think that a company s ratings were gained dishonestly  Austin Property Inspections did a terrible job inspecting the condo I just purchased  I had a friend who is also an inspector come look at the condo before the API official inspection  My friend s license is expired so he could not do the official report for me  My friend found several things that Samuel at API did not find  one of them requiring major electrical repair  At my friend s urging  I had an electrician come and access the house and it needed more than      worth of electrical work in repairs that API missed  Because API did not document the electrical problems  the seller refused to reimburse that cost  In addition  the refrigerator was not working properly and when I asked Gary at API about it  he told me they do not look at appliances like the refrigerator  that is not inluded in the inspection  I ended up having to buy a new refrigerator because of their neglect to let me know it did not work  So  the      I paid API  for the inspection was waste of money  When I asked Gary if he could at least refund me the cost of the inspection to help offset the many costs I incurred because of his company s neglect to find them  he ignored my request  Do not deal with these guys  I do not know how they have such high ratings in yelp but they are not a company to trust with such a large purchase ',\n 'A disappointment  The food was lackluster at best and the service was terribly slow   I wouldn t go back even with a Groupon ',\n 'This chevron never has receipt paper in their machines   I always have to go inside to get my

next time ',\n 'Service is terrible We ordered little amount of foods and it took    minutes to come in  When we asked for water  she stared at us saying she doesn t have any water badly  We asked to give little more side dish like Kimchi because they gave like   pieces of Kimchi  But they said to buy it  In most Asian restaurants they mostly refill any side dishes you want ',\n 'Horrible service

  pm  I had room on first floor my other family in  rd floor  Hair all over my sheets  Everything from long hair to straight hair to pubic hair  I was exhausted  Last thing I wanted to do at midnight was remake a bed  Went to front desk it literally took forever for her to find me  clean  sheets  Went back to room and  clean  sheets then had blood or feces on them  I was so disgusted I should have slept in my car  Instead I took the one clean top sheet and slept on top of that  All the hallways reek of cigarette smoke  The rooms were non smoking yet had ashtrays  The next morning I m getting dressed and see blood or feces or something smeared on the wall by bathroom  Will never ever stay here again  The night front desk agent was nice but morning front desk was extremely rude  She was standing on her cell phone and completely ignored me until I asked her if she wanted the room keys  Her reply  I guess since you already walked them all the way here  SMDH',\n 'Not happy with this location  I would recommend the Ashford Taco Mac location   I had some bad experiences at Taco Mac on Main St  and last night was one of them   A simple order of wings to go  ordered by phone   I

bring menus but when se did  she apologized  She took our order  didn t write anything down then came back and asked us what we ordered again  She brought   waters even though my boyfriend had asked for iced tea  about    minutes later brought our salads then came BACK and asked what we were waiting on so she could look out for it  Our   slices of pizza came another    minutes later like warm and not very flavorful  The couple behind us had to refill their own drinks and go searching for silver wear  After finishing our food and not being brought our check we went to the counter to pay  where

didn t even ask the ages of my kids   Just cancelled that reservation via Open Table and found another option for tonight   Maybe Bobs Steak House downtown will let my family dine in the main dining

we should open separate ones so we get more percentage off coupons  Why would we want more than one credit card  The percentages off that we do get are more than adequate since we don t actually live in the Kohl s store like this woman apparently does  As I m sure most other people do  we end up lying and saying we each have our own separate cards just to get her off our backs  We have made a game out of seeing if we can avoid being asked by her while we re there  but it s gotten to the point that even doing that it s still so irritating  I ve decided that even though this is the closest location to us  I won t be shopping here anymore ',\n 'My partner liked the food but it made me sick all night  Service was also odd  the server owner was on his phone the whole time ',\n 'Worst meal

great because I purchased a used bike for my daughter and it does not meet her current needs exactly and they are refusing any kind of return  I paid the price they asked but before I did I asked what

deal in any way to take this bike back claiming they just can t do that  I will not take any more business there as I am so disappointed in the honesty and integrity of the shop  I dealt with Brett so I recommend steering clear of the place if you re looking for an honest business',\n 'I booked a      appointment for my friend s wedding nearby  I arrived at     pm and asked if there was any way I

next  I let them know that I had to be out by      at the latest and they told me that would work  Finally at      I told them I didn t have any more time to wait and left  No apology  I just got an

got pretty good roommates   this has not been true for many other people I have spoken with at this apartment complex  It s luck of the draw and the odds are not in your favor  A guy I know in the complex had a roommate threaten his life and the life of his dog  he had to tell management he was going to pursue legal action before they would move the man into another room  The replacement roommate didn t clean to the point where his room should ve been declared a bio hazard  Like seriously  the guy threw up all over the wall and floor then covered it with a blanket and went out of town for a week    The main issue is if these people aren t your roommates  it means they re your neighbors  Mine are all people who barely know how to take care of themselves  let alone another living creature  but for some reason have all adopted puppies they re too immature to actually take care of  There s constantly dog feces everywhere  even on the stairs and cement walkways leading to your apartment  Sometimes  they just leave the dog outside  completely unsupervised even though complex policy is that they re required to be on a leash  I m amazed none of the dogs have gotten hit by cars    There s constantly garbage everywhere   there s was a pizza box with spaghetti in it that sat on the ground outside for   days  There s a tree off our balcony my neighbors like to throw trash into   at one point they were up to   pizza boxes  a pillow and a vodka bottle all stuck in this tree  The complex has people that come around and pick up some of it  but it s like they do the bare minimum and ignore the rest    Because the neighbors are dirty and leave trash everywhere  there are constantly roach problems  No matter how much you clean or how many times you put in a work order for pest control  which frequently gets ignored  you will still have roaches  Forever    They advertise  gigabyte internet  in every room  but it cuts out almost every week  so good luck with that    A significant problem is that the office only hires tenants so since the place is primarily occupied by idiot college students  the office is pretty much run by idiot college students  The few that actually try to do their job and aren t completely incompetent don t seem to have any power to actually accomplish anything and the rest are often either misinformed or flat out lying to you  My friend once had an issue with a staff member being incredibly rude to her so she tried to complain to someone   they told her to speak to the woman she needed to complain about    All in all  this place in absolutely awful and you should not live here at all ever ',\n 'I ve seen shuttles from all the off airport rentals at least twice now  Sixth  x  and still no Ace   When I called their number

      on lunch that went right to trash ',\n 'We were very excited  We made it date night  We are both in the hospitality industry and were really rooting for this to be a great place  Our spidey senses went off almost immediately  though    this was not going to be a great dining experience    Some of their failures are due to being new and can be fixed  The place was pretty empty  and the pointed choice by the owner  we asked  to not have any ambient music at all was disconcerting  Basically silence  punctuated by kitchen noise  I felt super sorry for the cooks  who apparently have to work in silence for their entire shifts  since otherwise that s all the guests would hear  Lose the attitude  Pipe in some sound  at least until business picks up   The ambiance left a little to be desired  Nothing special about it  relatively  uncomfortable tables lined up along the walls  some standard issue  New England fishing scheme  decor   But we were there for the food  so we tucked in  Service was OK  I didn t love the fact that  although admittedly my date was more outgoing than I was  the waiter addressed all of his remarks conversation etc  exclusively to him  I m female   And it didn t seem to be in a flirtatious way  more a completely ignoring that I existed way  A little weird  But  again  we re here for the food  So      I love lobster  particularly lobster rolls  which any shitty bar in New England can do adequately for under      or fantastically  if you re lucky   I ll certainly pay a premium since those little fellas have to be shipped across the country  but I did feel a little ridiculous eating     pub food  Nonetheless  we ordered a cup of each of the soups  Lobster Bisque and Salmon Chowder  to begin  and Lobster Newberg and a Lobster Roll entree to share   The bisque was very decent  Good smoked paprika flavor  nice  well cooked chunks of lobster   not rubbery and overdone at all  but fresh  juicy  and succulent  It wasn t fantastic  but gave us real hope for the lobster to follow  The salmon chowder was utterly forgettable   seriously  I ve had more memorable from a food cart  Not bad   just not special  and up here in the northwest  you can get fantastic salmon chowder pretty much everywhere  The plating was problematic  we ordered cups  and were served large  full bowls  We could very well have been satisfied and left at that point  given the amount of soup  Not complaining  I suppose  but this isn t a good sign that they know what they re doing  It looked bad as a presentation  and it s wasteful on the food costs   We didn t really have commentary on the much debated rolls  they were fine    I love the Northwest  but dammit  vegetables do not need to be added to every single dish    the addition of what appeared to be succotash to the lobster newberg was    surprising    and not in a good way  Whole peapods  baby carrots  and a ton of corn made this more  lobster pot pie  than newberg  The sauce was gummy  and the puff pastry was stiff  overworked  and flavorless  The lobster itself was lovely   well cooked and delicious  We picked it off of the dish and ate it alone   As for my lobster roll  I know there are two traditions  one erring more towards just butter as a binder  the other to mayonnaise  but completely dry lobster is a fail in both camps  The bun was fine  butter toasted hot dog style bread   the lobster was tasty and well cooked  but the whole thing was very dry   I craved a Cambridge bar roll  or at least some aioli on the side to baste this one with   Served with forgettable shoestring fries and a meh coleslaw    With the bisque being  good   the salmon chowder being  meh   the newberg being  downright awful   and the roll being  meh   nothing about the silent and sterile ambiance being comfortable and inclining us to spend more time there return be romantic eat more etc   and the prices being relatively high  there is absolutely no chance we would return or recommend this place  particularly when you could go to dozens of better comparably priced restaurants and have a marvelous dinner  presented beautifully  in a welcoming atmosphere   Psssst    just go to Le Pigeon  Right now  ',\n 'I ve been to European wax center before and I ve always loved it  This was my first time coming to this location and I will never go back  The woman at the front desk would not stop pushing me to buy a package  I understand you need to up sell but it wasn t my first time there  she knew that  yet she continued to go through each and every package and explain them  I just wanted to pay and there was another client behind me waiting to pay as well but she would not stop talking    I received a full Brazilian wax  When i went home i discovered that not only are there a few very noticeable missed patches of hair  but there was a lot of left over wax that was not properly removed  A lot     I had to go in the shower and essentially re wax myself  Most painful thing ever    Needless to say I m pretty upset and will be taking my business elsewhere ',\n 'I went to the Coolidge Corner location last Saturday morning for my first Brazilian wax  I read online what to do to prepare and did such  When I went in the front desk staff were very friendly and the waiting room looked clean  I was called back a few minutes later by the waxer  I forget her name  I think Kelsey  Once we went into the room I got undressed and she started wiping  I thought she was going to go through the process with me as I told her this was my first wax  She abruptly stopped  explained to me she had other clients booked after me and then said rudely what are your questions  After asking she did the first strip of wax which hurt more than anything in life I have experienced  I said can you give me a minute before the next one  She stated again that she did not have time to give me a break because she had other clients  After the second strip I screamed and said I did not want to continue this it was far too painful  She said I ve been doing this for over   years  my response was I m sure you have but this is not for me  She told me I could get dressed and as I pointed out the wax that was still left on my vagina and my skin was BLEEDING  She gave me a tissue and walked out of the room  I got dressed after placing tissue on my areas of skin that were still bleeding and left  Waxing is not for me I found it to be way too painful however this waxer was extremely unprofessional  She was blonde  She looked like she had been on an all night prior party bender with her makeup from the previous night still on  She had on scrubs that were completely wrinkled  Inside the exam room the floor was filthy  I know it is winter but clients are getting undressed the floor should be clean  Again had the experience been nice I could still say this wasn t for me but I d refer a friend here  hell no  It was dirty  the waxer was dirty looking and her attitude was stank  Also there was NO one in the waiting room as I left ',\n 'Horrible  We went on a Saturday night and the bar was loud and busy  Our party of   each ordered an entree  the food was bland and my chicken mac and cheese was so tough and dry that I had problems cutting it  The waitress clearly did not know the menu and forgot that my entree and my sons came with a salad  which I never got  The food is nothing to rave about  most of it seemed precooked  The prices are ridiculous for the quality of food  we spent almost     on a horrible meal and I hope I can help others avoid doing the same ',\n 'I was in the area and decided to check this place out    First  there are no real indicators on International to find this place    the address number isn t easily found nor the name of the business   it s

was annoyance that I was bothering them   They did not offer to cover any overdraft costs that I might incur due to their mistake but only agreed to do so after I spoke to them about it   Because of their incompetence and lack of customer service I ll never stay here again and I ll tell all my friends to avoid the place too ',\n 'It says on yelp that the food truck opens at   pm   We arrived at

that was topped with avocado    it came out with rotten avocado slices that were clearly not edible  Our server brought me more slices from the SAME AVOCADO   I left it on the plate right at the edge of the table and she ignored it  never checking to see if it was ok  Our kids  meals were not as described  and my husband said his was edible but not great  By the end we asked to speak with the manager to let them know our experience  We are business owners and would like to be given the chance to improve as well    Anyway  she came out and could not have cared less  She tried to make an excuse about the avocado  and then tried to get the conversation over faster by offering us     off our ticket  We didn t want that  just an acknowledgement of the errors and maybe some assurance that

message s      Needless to say  neither Jay nor anyone else ever bothered to return my phone call   Apparently once I left the store with that  Firearms Request Form   my request was promptly tossed in the Cabela s trash can   Or so I surmise  because Cabela s REALLY didn t seem to want my        Asking them to take    seconds out of their day with a returned phone call to update me was too much to ask  I guess   So I took my business to one of Cabela s local competitors  where I paid     more but didn t have to deal with the astounding lack of customer service I experienced at Cabela s   I do hope someone at Cabela s sees this review  and finds out why a customer can t receive the simple courtesy of a return phone all   Especially when THEY are the ones who initially said they would call me back   Unfortunately this experience is stereotypical for big box retailers like Cabela s  and serves as a good reminder as to why I should buy sporting products from local retailers who actually still care about providing good customer service   Going forward I think I ll take a pass on Cabela s   And for everyone else  be advised  if you ever need customer service from Cabela s you may or may not get it   Decide for yourselves whether you want to deal with that potential headache ',\n 'I came to this Starbucks a few minutes before closing time  They had thrown out all the coffee and would not serve me  Instead  they sent me to another Starbucks at a Barnes and Noble down the street  claiming it was open late  I drove there and it was closed as well ',\n 'Second time in a row I ve ordered pick up and the Pizza has been cold  If I m paying     for a pizza I d expect it to actually be hot when I pick it up  One of the times it wasn t even ready yet when I got there and it was still cold ',\n 'So this review is coming from a tourist who has never attended HHN previously  but was extremely excited to experience the Walking Dead and Silent Hill haunted houses as a bonus to our Disney vacation   In short  our whole experience at HHN was disastrous  We waited in line  in the rain  for       hours for each haunted house  and each house takes about     minutes to walk through  not the greatest wait time to ride time ratio    Everyone is herded into the houses in a continuous line  which really ruins the surprise element of the scares  We were always right behind the group that would be jumped at or surprised  so we weren t scared or surprised in the least   Universal really needs to evaluate their capacity limit for HHN  Even on a stormy night  the lines were ridiculously long  and we only got to experience a fraction of the houses due to the wait times   Unless you are a season pass holder with early access or fork over extra cash for the express pass  I wouldn t recommend attending  Don t waste a chunk of your night waiting in line for sub par haunted houses ',\n 'Horrible horrible service  They made us wait for    min for them to clear off a table  Then they pulled a reserve sign off of a table and gave it to us  After another    min without even being offered a drink  it was time to leave  Never going again ',\n 'Where do I start    I would give Zero stars for the apartment and management  First of all  there was no mention of any cleaning or insurance fees when we phoned to confirm our stay and specifically asked for the total amount the morning before we arrived  They added      for cleaning and insurance when we got there and said that the extra fees are displayed somewhere in the fine print on the website where we booked   The apartments are so darn old  dusty and has a depressing décor and inadequate lighting  The furniture looks and feel so cheap perhaps from the early   s  I could not stop sneezing from the dust in the air and on the furniture  The cable did not work most of the time and there was no WiFi access because the phone line was actually down  The AC did not cool the apartment down and there is a warning on the thermostat not to put below   F or it will freeze   The bathrooms are so outdated with broken tiles in the showers and rust on the air vents   I will upload some pictures which should speak for themselves   I was so glad to leave this place after a couple of nights  Never again and certainly nothing magical about these memories ',\n ' Updated              The audacity of that poster who thinks those of us who have been insulted by the rude staff are placing  worthless  reviews   Who the hell is he to determine how we feel about the rude and ignorant way we have been served and treated   His  great  service does not make ours any less authentic or real    The nerve of him  to even suggest otherwise  Even have the audacity to think that someone is insecure and have personal issues because the wait staff was extremely disrespectful  No  it s not their fault it s everyone else s  Yeah right    Not everyone is going to have the same experience and the staff should treat all its patrons with respect  courtesy  and kindness  I have been in a LOT of places of all walks of life and I very rarely experience this kind of ignorance   Your experience is yours and our experience is ours and we rate honestly and accordingly    Point  Blank  and Period   If Costello s do not want bad reviews then they NEED TO HAVE A TALK with their staff   That is what good business people do   I guess we should suck up the disrespectful treatment because the waitstaff is having a bad day   Are you fkn kidding me   When you are in the  hospitality  business you be hospitable regardless of what you have to deal with and what kind of day you are having   Unbelievable       If you want to be treated well by staff and have GREAT food and quality service  and drinks then I strongly suggest you walk ACROSS THE STREET TO THE GALWAY HOUSE    They also make an excellent dirty martini   Bartenders and staff are super friendly     Now on to the original review   I haven t been to this place in years   So I decide to check it out last night because they had a live band  I am giving this place one star due to the horrible attitude of the female bartender   I am talking MAJOR attitude   If you don t like your job  dealing with the public then find another line of work   Her disrespectful tone and pinched up face was extremely disturbing to Me   I won t ever go into that place again because of her for if she talked to Me and treated Me like that again she would see My ugly side   The male bartender was much more friendlier    If I ever go in there again it will not be on a day when she s working   Very disrespectful   You don t disrespect and give attitude to the f   n customers and expect tips     I ended up leaving there and going to Coco s Lounge  The hospitality shown at CoCo s lounge by the owner was exceptional   Very friendly   The waitresses had a smile  spoke to you with respect  and the service was fast   The patrons were nice and the latin music was good   Much better experience  I must say   When I go somewhere and I am spending My money I expect to be treated with respect by the staff persons and not spoken to with attitude    Period    If anyone knows the owner s of Costello s PLEASE let Me know via email   I am pretty offended by this bartender and I hope she isn t a relation   They need better staff   Hell I ll work there and give the patrons service with a f   n smile   ',\n 'Went for the first time on a rainy Friday night  so kinda empty  I ordered an appetizer and the Saag Paneer    Oh and a Kingfisher  I like my Indian food on fire and it was  However I finished my beer and water and was just left there to suffer in pain  I then dropped my serving spoon the waiter standing across the room glanced and did nothing    I had enough  marched over to him and said  seriously  I ve been sitting there for    min with my mouth on fire  He waved his hand at me as to say go back to you table  He then sent another waiter over      Ugh  I m sorry but there is way to many  choices in Indian food to have to put up with these buffoons     Never again ',\n 'The ABSOLUTE worst    I ve never had a rental company ask for insurance cards but what s worst is that even when you come with your insurance cards they ask for your insurance summary to prove your coverages  The inspection stickers on the car was expired  They said if you get a ticket mail it to them and they will pay it      yeah right  Ask for a refund and they give you a      number in which they may or may not give you a refund      The customer service is non existent The worst rental car company EVER   If your thinking about using them     DONT   ',\n 'The management is super rude  The manager acts like it is your privilege to be eating his food and any changes to the menu are beneath his kingdom  He also treats DoorDash customers very very poorly and is rude to the delivery person  All three doordash orders I ve made from here came with a major error to the order  The food is good if you can get them to actually give you what you ordered ',\n 'I echo many of the previous reviews   First  be very careful to review the  professional design  they put together for you   We had     sections that the salesperson filled with     cabinets and a    spacer which look VERY odd   In addition  the design shifted cabinets to leave odd spaces that don t look quite right   instead of bringing any of this to our attention in the store  we were left to figure it out after the fact   And we could have come up with some pretty simple  probably no cost  difference solutions   The sales staff are friendly  but looking to finish your order to move on to the next as quickly as possible   Second  they do not call back   If they say they will call you  or schedule a delivery  be prepared to call them daily to ensure they do what they say they will   It will be a one way street of communication   Guaranteed   I have emails of promised delivery on a Friday  but a Friday follow up call discovers the warehouse person is gone and no one knows what is happening   Follow up call on Monday  and promises that someone will bring it to me on their way home from work   Follow up call on Tuesday  same promise   Follow up call on Wednesday  and the delivery person is bringing it   Delivery person shows up Thursday  saying he never knew anything about delivery until that morning    You are paying for cabinets in a flat packed box   You get no information  no customer service  no call backs  etc   Plan on NOT getting the shipment on time when promised  and you should expect that it will be missing items with no idea when those items will arrive  a week        If schedule and customer service are important to you  and they should be    this is probably not your first choice   And I agree with other reviews   The cabinets are nice  but the price is not lower than other options   Cabinets to Go is an option when shopping around  not a cheaper option   We are happy with our kitchen  but it was painful ',\n 'Check your receipt very carefully if you shop here  Things are often rung up differently  usually more  than they are priced   Produce is not very fresh  Why is the quality at this store so inferior to other Star Markets  I d rather drive a mile and a half further to the one on route   just to get produce that isn t rotten by the time you get home ',\n 'There was a huge pile of puke outside their store that no one cleaned up  a homeless man begging for money right behind the puke  another homeless man using their phone at the photo center for over ten minutes  and the quality of my photos were so bad I had to return them  The current manager on site did not apologize for the poor quality and seemed to care less for that matter ',\n 'WIll not be going here ever again   Went out with friends for dinner here and were super excited to try it out   We put our names in and were told it would be about    minutes   After waiting for about    minutes we asked the host what was going on   He explained to us people were not leaving etc     he finally got us a couch to sit at while we proceeded to wait another    minutes for a table of    The service was so so poor   Finally the host told us how sorry he was and he would give us complimentary dessert   We felt better that as least they understood we had waited forever   We sat and our server again apologized to us about how long we had to wait and reminded us about our free dessert more than once   The food was sub par to say the least   The restaurant was SUPER loud because of the wedding going on next door and the bridal party kept running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks at the bar   After we finished dinner we decided we would just order   desserts to spit between both couples   When we ordered the two       desserts the waitress proceeded to tell us that we would only be getting one dessert free   Needless to say  horrible customer service and not very bright wait staff  the least she could have done was go ask if they could comp our        worth of dessert that they had reminded is   time that we would be getting  Very upsetting and disappointing night ',\n 'Coffee and sandwich place  I had a turkey sandwich  which was pretty good  Went to over a Latte after lunch at     pm  they close at  pm  and they told me no  because they already cleaned the machine    one star for poor customer service ',\n 'Grimy   seedy   unappetizing in every possible manner   This past Saturday    s dance night consisted of the overwhelming stench of human body odor  a sorry absence of fun hair metal rock  and an overabundance of emo new wave   dislike   That  and a    cover to experience the high school Rocky Horror brand of alternative  replete with many persons in possession of ripped clothing and crazy eyes   My heart swept to the nearby ZuZu and Middle East  Next time ',\n 'First of I m very very disappointed     this place is suppose to be Italian and they are far far from that  The pizza taste like old old cheese that was left out  I ordered a steak tip salad which I order a lot of from different places and this one is the worst by far  first of the tips where frozen cold which is disgusting  Second I got cooked peppers in a salad with no cucumbers  I went home and added cucumbers      then the Italian Calzone had nothing but cheese inside  and it tasted horrible  The French fries and the fried chicken tasted like a fried Egg     Hi hello clean the oil it s old  It was a waste of my money and if I could give it no stars I would   Lastly they wanted to over charge me and when I questioned it I got an attitude for it    we walked into all burning smoke air and it took another   mins to get my order that they told me would be ready in   mins  Kind you it took me   mins to get there  I would never ever recommend this place to anyone       it s disgusting',\n 'Horrible experience  the car was late picking us up   hour late   The driver did not help with baggage  We waited an additional   hours when arriving to the service at     am just to pick up our car  They are extremely understaffed  not the worker s fault  but there was only one guy on staff  He had to do   people s job  rent out cars  pick up cars from airport parking and even drive the cars back  So ridiculous  Would never use them again ',\n 'An open letter to TCV  Recently I missed an appointment  I understood the policy of charging a fee for a missed appointment and completely accept that as fair and reasonable  However I received a letter in the mail today regarding my missed appointment that was completely offensive and unprofessional  The letter stated that if I missed   appointments in a    month rolling period  for reasons that we do not find acceptable  I will no longer be permitted to receive care from any TCV location  I m going to tell a couple things  It is not MY privilege to be your customer  it is your privilege to have ME as a customer  Your customers can choose to be with a company that values their business  you however can not exist without customers  Secondly  who are you to determine what is an acceptable reason for missing an appointment  Have you elected a  Missed appointenet czar  who will determine my fate based on their arbitrary judgement  Why I missed an appointment in frankly none of your business  I and I alone will determine whether I have something more important or not  Your arrogance in this statement only highlights your obtuse regard for customer service   At this point  I will most likely search for a new privider whom I believe values me as customer  Considering that you view my business as a annoying obligation  you probably won t care much about my departure  But maybe you will realize that you have lost site of the basics of growing a business which is that every customer should feel appreciated and serviced with respect  and you will redirect your policies to reflect those values ',\n 'Customer service  they rush you to make decisions on food  Staff pressured us to order dimsum item we didn t want  Later found out it s left over food which they wanted to get rid of  Food  quality is poor  Whether rice or noodles  bland  little meats or veggies in them  Not fresh ingredients  Price  overpriced for the lack of quality  Do not recommend ',\n 'I ve been to this location a couple of times  the service has never been great but I ve come back for the good food  This time both the service and the food were absolutely horrible  My husband and I were starving and came in for a late dinner after a day of work and events  After I was seated first and waited for him to arrive  I ordered a cocktail that took about    minutes to arrive and it also took me asking  literally    times to receive a glass of water  I m pretty sure this was our server s first night on the job as he was incredibly awkward and forgetful and did absolutely no bussing unless we asked him to clear things  We ordered   appetizers  the firecracker shrimp and the trout dip  The trout dip was tolerable  but had an overwhelming mustard taste that drowned out any other flavor  The firecracker shrimp tasted like something from a cheap Chinese restaurant and was served with jarred chili sauce and a sickly sweet mayonnaise  Then came the entrees    which took us having to flag down our server long after we had finished our appetizers to order  His turkey meatloaf was decent though nothing spectacular  My barramuni was inedible  I don t know how a piece of fish can be simultaneously oily and dry  Not only that  it was completely unseasoned  but I still found it bland after adding salt and pepper  The fish was supposed to come with quinoa  squash and green beans  Underneath my disappointing piece of fish was maybe   tablespoons of quinoa and some mushy squash  This wouldn t have been a big deal if it hadn t taken so long for our server to check on our dishes  and then if a manager had come by in a timely manner  Instead we had to yet again flag down our server  and then when he seemed confused about what to do  we had to ask him to send over the manager  Even after taking my entree off the bill I was furious to have spent     on such a disappointing experience ',\n 'I can t tell you how disappointed we were in a late brunch here   After weeks of wanting to try this place out we finally picked a Saturday that the whole family could gather and meet for brunch   There were six of us celebrating a birthday     It started with a less than friendly greeting at the front door   Our waitress was unfriendly  lacked warmth and it felt like we were bothering her when we asked if we could order drinks and sticky buns which we saw when we came in   That s right  we had to ask for her if she could take our drink order   She didn t offer up any suggestions about the drinks or menu and every time we asked her opinion it was like pulling teeth to get her to answer   When our drinks finally arrived she neglegeted to ask our last guest who came in after we ordered drinks if she would like anything   We also reminded her that we would love the sticky buns now before we put in our order   She looked up and said   oh  yeah  you wanted sticky buns   I m looking at the counter from here and I can see we are out     I said   well  that s unfortunate  because you had them when we came in   Do you think you can check    She said   I ll see if we might have one In the back   Are you ready to order    We all looked at each other and thought  oh my god   are we being punked   We ordered and she came back with one sticky bun that we all split   Although it was delicious it was lost in the attitude and lack of creating a wonderful customer experience   We ordered our food and it came out quickly   We ordered the prawns and polenta   The prawns were okay but we re not deviened and really lacked a depth of flavor  The polenta could have used some salt  cheese anything because it was a bland blob of goop   The corn beef hash was over spiced  it tasted like a bottle of Mrs  Dash fell into the pan    The corned beef was tasty picked out by itself but it was over salted and spiced   The crispy chicken and waffles was a paper then chicken finger that used panko crumbs which made it taste like coconut shrimp   The waffle was crisp and delicious but it was ruined by what was suppose to be a sweet potato soufflé  it was more like a thick whipped cream concoction sprinkled with toasted coconut   It barely had any of the rum syrup drizzled on top  less than a teaspoon   The salmon cakes were mostly bread crumbs and poorly seasoned    When the waitress finally came over to check in on us  our drinks empty  she rattled off quickly   everything good  everybody love everything  I looked at her like are you kidding me   No   Can you tell me what s on top of this waffle   Is it some kind of whipped cream   Her response was   It s a sweet potato soufflé  I can get you whipped cream    I looked at her and said no thank you   She walked away  didn t ask if she could get me anything else and didn t ask if we would like anything else to drink   The food can be improved upon  bad service and the lack of creating an amazing customer experience can not   Taste your food before going out and dedicate some time to training your people to give an experience   I for one would rather drive downtown for better food  great service and an experience I m willing to tell my friends about    This unfortunately  will not be a place I would recommend ',\n 'We went for a birthday celebration and because the birthday boys girlfriend was interested in potentially working in the kitchen when she graduates from culinary school  It was all of our first time  The restaurant was a huge vast empty room at   o clock on a Sunday  There were   tables sitting outside on this beautiful Sunday evening  We were tempted to sit outside or just in the bar area but since we made reservations  decided to sit at a table  Every step of the way was extremely and painfully awkward and full of missteps  The server was extremely uninformed of the house wine types  We asked if we could get items off the  cafe  menu and he didn t know and then informed us the kitchen said no  He didn t write any of our orders down and messed up on our drinks  forgot an appetizer  and when we asked about it  was dumbfounded and asked if we still wanted it      and got one of the main courses wrong  And that was after he blamed the computer for malfunctioning and so he had to ask again to confirm our dinner orders  Twice I had to get up to ask for more water  And this is an empty restaurant  I personally have been a server for the last    years and can not believe the service and lack of care from the guy  For the kind of money you re charging  the food better be damn good and even better service  The food was alright but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth  No wonder the place was empty ',\n 'Decided to try this out on New Years with my boyfriend  We were SO DISAPPOINTED  We sat down at our table and knew we wanted to get a flight of beers  Our waitress who I found out later is the manager  says it s on the board at the bar  So we go up and try to right down our selections and they don t know where markers are  We go back to sit down and they were seating another family at our table  For the inconvenience our waitress aka manager says to get a   pick flight instead of   and she will charge us for   pick  This is when she says she can do that cause she s the manager  Umm okay thanks for saving me     We should have left I know    My salmon tacos were salmon mush tacos  Not a single chunk of salmon    My boyfriends prawns were just okay  He said the fries were gross   We definitely went to the wrong place  I left and got a cheese pizza and beer and went home ',\n 'If I could give kanes a zero I would  I purchased a      dollar sofa set from them in       The leather peeled off on both the sofa and the love seat  They would not fix it  they would not contact me when they said they would  They have the worst customer service and they have a recording that says your furniture is guaranteed for life  That is a lie   I have purchased a dining set  a bedroom set and a      dollar mattress from Kanes   After the sofa set and the way they treated me I would never buy from them again   I strongly urge you to purchase your furniture from any other company  If not you will reqret dealing with Kanes if you have a problem ',\n 'My experience in the store today was so bad that I decided it needed to be noted  I needed a black sweater for work and I live right down the street from this location so i made a quick trip there to get one  I walk in the store and after a few minutes I was greeted by a male employee that was very friendly  I find a sweater I liked and go back to the fitting rooms to try it on  No one was back there so after a minute or two I let myself in one of the rooms  Once I am ready to check out  I go to registers up front  No one was up there either so I wait  A redhead girl walks up after a few minutes and says nothing to me  just grabs the sweater from the counter and starts ringing it up  I mention to her that I had an email for a free nail polish with purchase  She asks to see it so I pull it up on my phone to show her  She looked at it and then says  i ll be right back   I wait longer for her to come back up to the front and finish ringing me up  She finally comes back up and hands me a sheet up paper with nail polish names on it and says those are the ones I could get  I pick about    up to see if the names on the bottom match the names on the list while she stands there and watches me  After I found none that actually were on the list I asked if they even had any of the ones that were offered in the promotion  She said   I think we have the space blue    After I had looked at all of them     I give up on the nail polish and say never mind  No apology or anything from her  She just continues to ring up my sweater and after that whole ordeal and her rude attitude  I decide that there is no way in hell I am about to pay     for a generic black sweater I could get anywhere else  I told her I no longer wanted it and I walked out  I was willing to pay the price for convince just because I wanted it immediately  but she completely pissed me off and ruined my experience  I won t be going back any time soon ',\n 'Quality of food is good but a rip off  just be beware if you order food to go  your California rolls will hardly have any crab in it  They stuffed in too much cucumber and avocado in it   Also  the tuna rolls were not fresh  SMH ',\n 'Terrible  Made an appointment the day before to have a car towed from one location to another  It was the beginning of a holiday weekend  so timing was urgent to get there before they closed    After not hearing from them  I called them in the afternoon  He supposedly had trouble with his truck and was going to send someone else  Just got a call from the backup driver   he knew absolutely nothing and had just gotten an urgent call for a tow  He  the second driver  thought I was stranded somewhere    So now  after a no show  no call  it is too late for the car to be towed in time for anything to get done    Will never call them again   ',\n 'Let me begin by saying that Chili s has to be one of my favorite to go spots  I ve been to    different locations including locations in New York but this specific location  It is unbelievably horrible  the service is terrible  the food was a waste   My sister order was mistakenly mixed up and when we went ahead and told our server her response was  Well that was what I understood  I kindly asked if she can correct it and her response was  It ll take a while before the food comes out sooo      Our chips tasted old and the guacamole was not fresh  We asked to change it and she practically brought out the same batter with the remark of  This was freshly made today and it s all that we have    I should ve spoken to the manager  but once our meal was done we all just wanted to get out of there   I would not recommend this place not even to my worse enemy ',\n 'Avocado sauce  What in hell is that  Sweet mother of Jesus  I bet they were serving avocados and guacamole during the inflation crisis of the Seventies  Even the sour cream was runny  The al pastor in my enchiladas tasted like charred bark dust after it had been shoveled from a closed down elementary school on a dreary and drizzly November day  Oh  and enchilada sauce  Must have been an afterthought  or was that it wasn t there because you burnt it all to hell and had a hard time scraping it off the bottom of the pot with a knife  Seriously  to hell with this place  and I m talking at least Dante s third level ',\n 'If I could give    I would  HORRIBLE service  Took over an hour just standing on line nd another hour to get the car  Made a reservation for a van  The van was not available when we reached there  Then a van pulls up with a family in it nd had to wait for the company to then clean the van out  It was terrible ',\n 'Review is for food only  Last year I was in town and me and a friend were really wasted and ate here  We remember going on and on about how   surprisingly  amazing the food was  So this year  we re back in town and we re all  we HAVE to order from here for dinner   our drunk taste buds can t be that far off   oh  but they were  We threw most of our food away   even   gasp  egg rolls  I eat my way through a lot of cheap Chinese places  but this is definitely closer to terrible than good food  I don t doubt it s a fun place to end up at night and by all means  get your drunk food on  but never eat here sober ',\n 'I was diagnosed with epilepsy over    years ago I have sat in a lot of lobby s lol  I rather have a intelligent doctor who knows what he or she is doing instead of a doctor who doesn t care about me   This man flat out told me that he was going to give me a shot of a medication and it would do   of   things either stop the seizures or make me go into multiple convulsions  and let me walk out of his office into my vehicle  Who does that  Whom  I really wish I could remember what the name of that shot was  because down the street I went into grand mal after I woke up   days later   I changed doctors   Now I have found the best neurologist in Austin Texas  if anyone would like to find real doctor not this JOKE check them out  http   www austinepilepsy com',\n 'About a week ago  my friend and I spotted this place on our way home from dinner and decided that next week we give it a try   We opted out of dessert over at Flemings to try the crepes here instead  Sorry to say  we were both VERY disappointed in this place and won t be coming back   I hate leaving a review like this  but I d rather be honest about MY experience  First of all  I m German and I know good crepes  When I walked in  we weren t even greeted with a friendly hello by the gentleman that worked there  He didn t have much of a personality and frankly  I thought he was a bit rude   I asked him if they served Cafe con leche and the guy actually had NO idea what that was  They have a huge cappuccino maker and other coffees to choose from  and he didn t even know what cafe con leche was     We both ordered the Nutella and Banana crepe  When I watched him make it  he literally  drizzled  a small amount of Nutella on the huge crepe and used an entire banana  Overkill on the banana and not enough Nutella at all  The crepes were WAY too thick also and since most of it was all just dough   it didn t have much of a taste to it either   There is a picture on their menu with an ice cream topped crepe  but guess what   they don t have ice cream  False advertising  If your going to have a picture of something on your menu  you better darn well serve it   We both wished we had our dessert at dinner after the experience we had  but we are glad we came here too  Now we know we will not be coming back here unless they make changes  Add more of the spreadable ingredients   and SPREAD it ALL over the crepe so that the flavor is throughout   They have it decorated nicely and it s very clean  The lady that made my cappuccino was friendly  I don t like giving reviews like this  but   that s what Yelp is for and maybe someone else will have a better experience than we did ',\n 'This Starbucks is terrible  Staff is not friendly  My coffee tasted nothing like it should of and tasted more of water then coffee  I m afraid to even have them correct it with their poor service they gave me to start with  I ll just drink it or toss it  This one is also slow considering it s dragon con and it s packed',\n 'This was a sad day as to are family only went to red robbin because they have good mud pies  But we met by an unfriendly hostess we were sat fairly quickly  After ordering are tiny donuts and mud pies we had to wait over    minutes to get are donuts  But to are dismay they was no mud pie and the server told us that they had to give it to another party  Over all the food was bad  the donuts that we got tasted like fish because it was made in the same grease that the fish is made in  The visit was vary unpleasant and left us upset',\n 'This DD is the absolute worst  Every single time I come here they are always out of normal things  and when they actually have things in stock  it takes forever to get it after you order ',\n 'I called Alliance   days ago based on good Yelp reviews   The owner answered and I started to describe the issue with the garage and I was requesting an estimate  He cut me off and said  Just text me the address and I ll let you know when I can go by and look at it   I wanted to explain some more details about what I was looking for and that I would need to arrange a time to meet him there   Again  he cut me off and said  Just text me the address and I ll let you know when I can go by and look at it    I haven t run into someone being so rude on the phone in a long time   and I deal with people and businesses all the time   I needed the work done  so I texted my address and he responded that he would text or call when we could meet   Well  that was now   days ago   I guess he didn t want my business       UPDATE    days after I wrote this review  I got a text that he could meet me later that day   I told him I had already hired another company to do the work   Other reviews of this company say the response and service was quick  I don t know what happened in my case   there is no way I m going to wait   days to get a response for an estimate ',\n 'Let me start by saying that I love red Robin  but this particular one has horrible service  first they forgot my BF s drink  then they forgot my burger  and they also neglected to refill anyone at my table s drink without being asked  I will probably never come to this location again ',\n 'This store is the closest to my house  so I have gone here a few times  although I ve been disappointed each time   If you are heading out to do some grocery shopping  I suggest to pass this one up   There are too many HEBs in the area to spend time here   This one is dirty  as the other reviews suggest  and do not have better prices to make going here worth it   The fruit and veggie selection is limited and not very fresh   There are some shady characters who hang around the lot sometimes   The staff is not particularly helpful  although some are nice enough    And typically when I go here  I have to go to another store to get a few more items to complete my list   I am choosing to drive an extra mile from now on to avoid this disappointing store ',\n 'Ordered food here today  got it mixed up with the other dosa place next door that I usually go to  I haven t been here in a while and I was not happy with the food  The portion for the chicken    was so little and salty  as was the biryani my family had ordered  No spice at all and I asked for it to be spicy  Also what they advertise as biryani was not actual biryani  it looked like they just mixed curry gravy into rice  which isn t what biryani is  It was not favourful and the meat portion was so small  On top of that the lamb was tough and chewy  The raita was super thick and had a paste like texture  and the gravy was also salty  I don t think I will return back  the food is nowhere near what it used to be like a few years ago  Highly disappointed ',\n 'Had a truly terrible experience at your establishment      Main Street Reading MA  last night  October         at  PM    Crew was incredibly unprofessional   Yelling  screaming and swearing at one another  especially the large woman in the purple shirt who I assume is the manager   It was intimidating and horrible as the woman even yelled out the  F word  right in front of us and I had two children with me that are ages   and     In addition  the crew was super rude right tin front of the customers   Chatting about inappropriate things among themselves  talking on the phone  eating in the front end register area  etc    All the while the restaurant and restrooms are filthy dirty and customers are literally being ignored   This is not the first bad experience I had here   Last time  it was the same scenario with the total lack of professionalism AND a young employee had gone outside to smoke a cigarette right in front of ht front door of the restaurant resting alongside the fence to the kid s playground where my children were playing   I know it s McDonald s and not meant to be fine dining in a   start restaurant or anything like that    but this level of disgusting behavior can not be tolerated   Whomever owns this franchise needs to get it under control  Fire the entire crew and start over ',\n 'Do NOT stay here  My husband  I  and our younger kids stayed here this last Saturday for a basketball tournament to wake up to a note on the door with      charge on our card for accusing us of smoking in our room  We don t smoke and it was not our room   After multiple times telling them it was not us  my husband even telling the front desk to come to our room to see for themselves they refused  Absolutely ridiculous and not only will we nor the program we are with ever stay here again  Which is       rooms each year  I will also be reporting them to the BBB as well as putting it out there on any review I can to warn anyone how our experience was  I am disputing this charge with my credit card company but the fact I have to take extra time out to get this fixed is ridiculous  I have left two msgs with a manager with no response ',\n 'I wish I could give this     stars  Our couch was delivered with two giant rips in the front that had been awfully stitched together in some sort of effort to hide the obvious from us  They then tried to convince us that we knew it was there when we bought it  This could not be further from the truth  I would never spend that much money on a ripped couch with an awful amateur repair job  It was also missing the throw pillows  When we refused to sign for this couch the movers started becoming aggressive and harassing almost that we sign  Once they removed the couch and left I called customer service who offered us an  in store credit  as opposed to a refund  Not okay  To top it off  after the movers left I noticed a giant chunk of my door frame had been taken out  by the delivery guys  When I emailed customer service about this with a photo attached  I specifically noted in the email   call MY cell phone number  as my boyfriend is not able to answer his personal phone at work like I can  and gave them my number  Who did they call about this issue  My boyfriend  And then when he told them how aggressive and disrespectful the movers were the  supervisor  began chuckling  Not sure why rude disrespectful behavior ir your employees  or employees you subcontract out is funny  but I will be leaving negative reviews now on every outlet possible  Do  Not  Shop  Here ',\n 'Caliga often ties up dogs while gardening and yells at them like misbehaved children  She does not appear to rigorously exercise the dogs and generally has several dogs in tow ',\n 'I don t think I have ever been to this location without my order being incorrect  The most recent time that I went  I ordered a full size Roasted Turkey   Avocado BLT sandwich with no tomato  When I arrived home  I realized that I was given only half of my sandwich with tomato on it  It is not a very close location from my home  so I called and the manager said that she would mail me a voucher since I was unable to drive back to have it corrected  I gave her my mailing address and never received anything  I then had to contact corporate twice to have the issue resolved  I do not see myself going back to this location any time soon  if at all  Save your money and go elsewhere ',\n 'Rating solely on dancing aspect   No cover  easy parking and lots of bartenders   Place was so packed it was very hard to dance  If you like to dance with a group of friends or don t mind being restrained then dj will do  Only heard one bachata song and the rest regueton and hip hop in a span of    minutes   For those that truly like Latin dancing like salsa and bachata and want to dance  this is not the place  It s not possible to dance with a partner at all or do turns ',\n 'I was looking forward to this foodie experience and left very disappointed  First course salad Fabulous second course Fish OVERCOOKED  Thirdcourse Waygu beef OVERCOOKED LEATHER  there were people on both sides of me who attempted to cut and eat and could NOT  I was not the only one who sent my dish back untouched  the foie gras topping  was good  but not enough to help make the beef edible  We didn t even have the option to comment or send it back  The Table should be imbarrassed and ashamed       Fourth course cheese plate minimal but enjoyable  Fifth Dessert was a home run  Blueberry buckle and flan over duck egg pavlova  like meringue   and a side of extra mini treats  Wine pairings were enjoyable  atmosphere was fantastic Customer service SUCKED   I watched them clear FOUR Waygu beef plates that were UNTOUCHED because they were SO OVERCOOKED and not edible  NOT ONE CHEF  SERVER ASKED OR APOLOGIZED FIR THE DISGUSTING BEEF    When a chef sees numerous plates of UNEATEN food returned to kitchen and doesn t find out why    They clearly DO NOT CARE    They are  trained chefs  and plated  over cooked fish and beef and served it to us   INSULTING  DISGUSTING OBNOXIOUS    TAKE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND IT SOMEWHERE ELSE       THE TABLE does NOT deserve patrons with the overcooked food they intentionally served us     Not to mention when we finally commented on the over cooked beef  they could have cared less   I am so disappointed because I like to support local restaraunts  especially who use local products  BUT I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING The Table      SIDENOTE  I went with friends who were repeat customers and said their first experience was AMAZING  However the experience this time was disappointing to our friends as well  A restaraunt  that isn t consistent at that level of  cooking dining  experience is NOT acceptable  Especially since the owners chefs could care less that they served their paying guests OVERCOOKED meat and fish    No excuse    ',\n 'Worst hair cut ever  not only myself but my husband just needed a trim around his neck   she trimmed around ears etc   all uneven husband told her about it so she trimmed more still uneven

disappointed the last two times I came here  They re always out of black beans  that s what upsets me most  The first of my last two experiences I had a bowl  the black bean was running low but they just decided to scrape up all the goop of the beans and put it in my bowl anyway  Made me so sick I actually could not keep it down  that should have been my final time but I gave it another go  Again  they had zero black beans  and I can t blame them for that entirely  but still frustrating  I was having another bowl but they were out so I then decided I was not going to get anything  no big deal  but then the manager or owner  I m not sure  became very flustered  I told him over and over that it was okay and he didn t need to worry but he continued to push and then got me a free burrito card  not complaining  however the young girl at the register was very catty at me  and asked right in front of me  why does she deserve that   I was blown away  very unprofessional  she also had a hicky on her neck  classy  Won t be going back  thanks for the free burrito though ',\n 'LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME LAME    There is nothing original about this show  This Bobby Bones character uses Howard Stern

today   didn t even get to buy any chocolate  What a disappointment  This place is nothing to spend your money on  Trust me ',\n 'So my colleagues and I gave this place another shot   rd time s the charm  right   I m finding it difficult to find the words to express just how repugnant the  food  is that this establishment has to offer   All of our orders were wrong once again  Weighing my options I figured its better than starving   As it turns out perhaps I was incorrect as this meal was so low quality I actually felt toxic eating this garbage   And the cost   Almost     for three entrees that would honestly be collectively priced at      tops  PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this poor excuse of an eatery ',\n 'I recently moved to the area so I have the unfortunate task of trying to find a quality nail salon  I found This place and because of the many positive reviews I gave it a chance  I called    minutes before to see if they accepted walk ins and was told by the gentleman who answered the phones they did so I took the drive to the salon  Upon entering it was very dark  maybe because they call themselves a spa it was part of the ambiance  It was not very clean and many of the stations seemed to be crowded with junk  I wanted just a gel polish change but they would only let me do it with a manicure  I had to take it upon myself to find the board that had the gel polish nail colors  And most of them seemed old  definitely not a color selection that s impressing  The guy doing my nails seemed to be in a rush and was not paying attention to what he was doing  My nails were not filed straight and when I pointed it out he got annoyed  Then when buffing my nailed he cut the skin on my fingers  Don t even get me started on my cuticles that are worse now than when he started  I will not be back  and maybe it was just my experience but it was not work the     they charge for a crappy  manicure   Look at the other options in the area ',\n '    So  you know when you read Yelp reviews that are terrible  and you say to yourself   Okay  angry human   Write your yelp review and take some deep breaths  It s not a big deal   WELL  I ve never written a yelp review until this place  Not only haven I physically gone to this place a few times  but I ve lazy lunch ordered with friends through Uber eats from here  Intercom apparently broken in drive thru   sat there for about   minutes before I reversed and went to the other one  so that review was true  Immediately I noticed the fries had the oddest rotten taste  and chicken CLEARLY wasn t cooked through  and that s saying something for McDonald s   The icing on this cake was when I ordered through uber eats  I ordered three meals with friends  multiple drinks  desserts  and even breakfast for the next morning  to make the uber delivery fee  worth while   When the delivery arrived  the driver said  sorry  this is all they had    and handed be a    piece of chicken nuggets  TELL ME THEY

with   friends  We each ordered separately and we re lucky to find a table   My order arrived at       barely warm  The next order was delivered around       after inquiring with a server at       the order was delivered at        There were also numerous tables also waiting for food  some went to the counter and asked for refunds   Even though the store has only been open fora week  corporate should have at least some experienced staff from other locations to ensure a successful opening week   Not related to the bad service  one of the windows was boarded up    Never again ',\n 'I d like to update you all on my situation below with my  rebate    I went back into the store and spoke to yet another store associate  Kevin  who informed me that the sales associate I had originally dealt with was no longer with the company   From there he called some sort of manager who told me  sorry you have to keep the gift cards we gave you   UNACCEPTABLE   I was told it was a rebate  Actual money not gift cards to home depot   From there Kevin called a regional manager who finally agreed to refund my credit card the        Sound great right   WRONG   That was almost two weeks ago  No refund  and now I can t even find Kevin   isn t that convenient   Sorry Sleepy s but I am NOT giving up  You owe me        I am now filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau  Hopefully that will get

back to get the rental car he drove over a curb  The car they gave me had a caution light on  I needed to return it in   days because the windshield wipers didn t work and it was raining out  They gave me another car with a caution light warning that something needed to be done with the car  Three days later another caution light went on and I needed to return the car  The newest car was filthy inside  I would need to clean the entire inside since it was covered in pollen  I immediately returned it to get another car that smelled like smoke  Wow   Take care of your cars and have respect for your customers  Give them a CLEAN CAR  Take the time to clean the windshield as if you were going to be driving it   ',\n 'Really disappointed here when I dropped by for lunch  Looking back I don t think there is one positive thing I can say about this place based upon my experience   It went south right away when we found ourselves waiting five minutes at the hostess stand to be seated  When she finally did appear  there was no apology or explanation offered  The place looked to be about half full but perhaps they were short staffed   We did get our drinks ordered and delivered quickly  ok one good thing  but from there it took    minutes for us to get our food ordered and out from the kitchen  I went with the sliders and my table mates both got the grouper sandwich    My sliders arrived luke warm at best  had stale buns  were overcooked and lack any flavor  As a side  I picked homemade chips that were cold  not crispy and again not really tasty  At this point  we were late to get back from lunch or I would have sent everything back    Service was spotty throughout with my water glass going empty on two occasions and no real feedback on why things were so slow   Sorry to say you can do much better than here and this will be a land soon forgotten ',\n 'Terrible customer service  We ordered    wings on a Tuesday night  After waiting an hour and a half we called the store and the manager said that the delivery was almost to our house and that he d give us a    off coupon for THE NEXT ORDER  After another    minutes  we got a call from the delivery guy asking for directions to our house because he couldn t find it on GPS  We ve ordered wings multiple times from local restaurants and have never had trouble like this  I called to find out where our driver was again   then was hung up on  We re at the   hour mark and we still haven t gotten a delivery  I ll never order from this company again   The fact that a     off next order  coupon was offered was a joke  There s no way they re getting my business again ',\n 'Drinks are expensive  not worth the free ticket for the country concert my gf and I went to   I also left my fitbit there  called their

there are great reviews  It wasn t busy when I arrived with my friend  and when we walked in  there was no one at the hostess stand  We stood there for a few minutes before the hostess walked up  and just looked at us until we spoke up that we needed a table for two  She told us that if we sit at the bar  the food is     off and when we nodded  she said  seat yourself  in a rude and unwelcoming manner  She failed to smile at us or make us feel welcome throughout this exchange    We found seats at the bar  and the bartender was nice to us  although she took a while to acknowledge us and bring us hot sauce when we asked for it  I ordered the steak and Migas Benedict and my friend ordered the crab cake Benedict  Our food was cold for the most part  When we finished eating  we sat for over    minutes waiting to be acknowledged   The bartender failed to even glance at us and she made herself busy acknowledging everyone else who came up to the bar and completed drink orders  If anything  it felt like she was avoiding us  I understand that it may be understaffed but it takes two seconds to ask how everything is going    After waiting  she finally said  I ll be right with you    It took her another   minutes to be  right with us   She then proceeded to print the check without asking us if we wanted anything else  which to us made it seem like we were being kicked out  feeling even more unwelcome than before    The food was mediocre for the price that we paid  For a nice and pricey cafe  the staff was very rude  I could have very well spent my money elsewhere that is even busier but still receive superb service    Would I recommend this place to anyone  Not at all        my friend is also a waitress  so we were being generous with our expectations and even with our tip

However the most recent trip in proved it could get worse  We were served by a worker who started about a month or so ago  I have seen her a few times but never been helped by her  She would always run to the back as soon as customers came in  But this time when the other workers were busy and she had to step forward and actually do customer service like her job describes  she did a very poor job of it  She said her name is Hannah  She has blue hair  a lip ring  and gauged ears if that helps describe her  She was rather soft spoken and when I asked her to speak up a bit so I could hear better she suddenly gave me attitude at my request  So the whole process of dishing up my ice cream was far from pleasant  I then proceeded to ask a question regarding other workers and she snapped at me to  JUST HAVE A GOOD DAY  and stormed off to the back  Extremely rude  Apparently she has done something similar to a friend s friend of mine  She seems to have the lack of decent people skills  and lack of work effort  I am sorry but people who act like this should not be working in a place that caters to customers directly  Personally I do not see how she got this job as she is rude and unprofessional ',\n 'What has happened here    ARROGANT  almost dismissive owner and hostess    Service was matter of fact    Food was much better on previous   or   visits but acceptable     I think

disgusted that they would charge the prices they do an not make an attempt to serve better food  It was frozen no taste  garbage ',\n 'Walked in with my boyfriend and waited to be seated  The restaurant was small enough that every server saw us walk in and ignored us  One server walked by us to bus a table and said nothing about whether or not someone would be able to help us  The bartender walked by and said nothing  Then all of the workers held a pow wow and glanced over at us and kept talking  In the corner  we saw a couple who had been sat  with empty glasses and menus in front of them  looking around for their waiter  They had similar looks of frustration  Figured if we had this much trouble getting a table  we d probably have as much trouble actually getting our order taken  Disappointed that I couldn t get my ramen fix in but luckily  Rain was a couple feet away and more than willing to seat and serve us in a reasonable amount of time ',\n 'Jerk in the grey ponytail tried to tell me I had to accept his offer for all items I wanted to sell as a lump  and he would not give me a separate price for each  So what if I brought in each piece separately     I couldn t be bothered to argue with the idiot  so he got to see my back   leaving the store with their lost business  I m giving the books and records away for free to the thrift stores  rather than deal with those jerks ',\n 'I had a horrible experience staying at a doubletree several months ago and was given a certificate for one night to give them another try  My experience was worse than the last time  Doubletree apparently has really gone down hill   I will never stay at another Doubletree again   This particular location is a good walk to downtown where north market and the restaurants are so just be aware when making reservations   We arrived and the parking situation is not that great  you share a public parking garage and it costs     per night with no valet  It s hard to get your luggage to and from the car due to the location of parking  You have to go up to the lobby and then another elevator to the main floors  I could live with that   the issue was the cleanliness and the service   The king room was a very nice size but very dated and our room was not clean  Stains on the walls  bathroom was not clean   shower still had hair in it   The bar in the restaurant is fine  if you are lucky enough to get the good bartender otherwise you have someone that doesn t know the first thing about making a drink  Which leads me to the free breakfast from the restaurant  I was not expecting   star dining but again cleanliness and service horrible  The breakfast buffet was laid out with over cooked sausage and bacon  stale bread and bagels  eggs were never brought out  We sat down  lay  our napkins out and were appalled to have hair all over our napkins  As if that wasn t enough that evening our neighbors decided to have a party until   AM   We awoke to very loud yelling and laughing  etc  about   AM  We called down to the front desk continuously but no one ever did anything about it  These walls must be paper thin because it was as if they were in the same room with us  Sorry  will not be staying here again  I love Hilton properties but I am done with this one ',\n 'Service was terrible and the kitchen  forgot  my order  everybody from my table Finnish

my brother s birthday there a couple months ago  which my sister in law planned with a lot of effort and they screwed up those reservations as well making everyone wait two hours and comping   appetizers for the inconvenience   I had been there when it was Tavern on the Water and clearly the new management is running around with its head cut off not knowing which way is up   Although a great location  I cannot anticipate trying to go back to this place again ',\n 'Picked up a to go order  Literally the worst food we have had in a long time  My pasta was not cooked  they forgot my

that I had to warn others   We went with a party of    people  We had made a reservation  We  got to the restaurant at       No one came to offer us even menus or water  until  we Had been sitting  for about    min   They had a large party on the other side of the restaurant  They were only paying attention to that side   There were only two tables with patrons on this side of the restaurant    There were people   staff standing around doing nothing initially and still did not come to ask us anything   The music was so terribly loud from the party side  we could not  hear each other nor even converse with the waitress when she finally did come  Most of us developed headaches  We finally ordered and it took over an hour for the kids pasta to even come out  Close to the end we could not wait anymore  The kids were asleep on the bed seating area  We had to get up and leave Before our dinner even arrived   The waitress told me to go get some fresh air from outside   And that the food should be ready soon   it was   ° and raining  by the way   Was she out of her mind       of us left while the others waited for the food to come still      My husband  stated that this is the most

ultimately scheduled for       am  Move Drs called at       on April   to cancel  Their reason was that they had a fire in their office and when I asked  they reported that they did  in fact  have mover crews and trucks available  but the manager decided to bring the crews in to clean up the office instead of taking care of the appointments that they had already committed to  I certainly hope there were other extenuating circumstances   It seems like a better choice would have been to hire a cleaning crew and kept the moving crews and trucks working to take care of the customers       Move Drs also told me twice they would find another company to move me later that same day but I never received either a call from a new mover  nor a follow up call from Move Drs  All of this was last minute and ended up costing me substantially more in surcharges since I did not have a prior scheduled appointment    To me  Move Drs views their business as a one time customer exposure with little attention to any repeat business and cares nothing about service',\n 'I have been going for years the people here are always kind and nice but today there was a colored lady and man behind the counter

never going there again',\n 'I would not recommend this place if you are looking for delicious lobster   The lobsters were chewy like eating rubber   Over cooked  I spoke with the manager and he was very cordial to me  I asked about how long they were cooking the lobsters   He advised they were pre cooked   Then later reheated   My whole family was disappointed  The manager offered to bring us fresher lobsters but it was all the same   Very disappointing   I paid the hefty bill and didn t complain  Our server was very nice and attentive and I tipped her very well   It s not her fault lobsters are cooked twice   The rest of the food on the buffet was just ok    Never again   Red lobster was fantastic the next night tho ',\n 'NEVER AGAIN   I have lived in Newton for    years and every five years or so I get soft and give this place another try   This will be the last time unless my family decides to hold my wake there as some cruel joke   They treat the chips and salsa like they are caviar and their customers like they are a worthless commodity   A friendly waitress could have provided some solace  but alas  we were sorely disappointed there too  can you say  attitude on steroids     The last thing Newton Centre needs is another coffee shop or bank  but someone needs to pave this place over and put the rest of us out of our misery   ',\n 'I ordered delivery from City Thai through GrubHub   I was given an estimate of     hours  which was understandable given that the weather was crappy   After     hours I contacted GrubHub to find out where my food was   If the restaurant needed to cancel because of weather or some other reason  that is one thing  but I heard nothing from them   GrubHub reached out to the restaurant who said they were starting my order and promised it would be delivered in       ADDITIONAL minutes   The restaurant had confirmed this  and I was told they were offering the delivery service directly   OK  fine  at least I will get to eat dinner  and at this point it s too late to order delivery or pickup anywhere else   At     hours  I contacted them again and subsequently received an email saying the order was cancelled because it was after       and the restaurant was closed   I realize the GrubHub shares the blame here  but this is abysmal customer service from City Thai   It is honestly inexcusable   It is one thing to need to cancel an order because of weather  or driver issues  etc  but to provide  sparse  updates confirming that the order will be delivered and then simply close is un freaking believable   There are plenty of other decent Thai places in Portland  please don t waste your time with this one ',\n 'Today was my first and last time here  this places sucked  They offer  complimentary mimosas  which we never got to see or taste  After numerous reminder about our drinks they kept telling us glasses were been cleaned up  then we asked again and she forgot  Then nada  we asked again then she tells us they ran out of mimosas after we waited over       mins  Next time we noticed that people that just got there were been served mimosas  wtf  Then she said I was told we were out let me check again  at that point we did not care as we were leaving  Wait time awful  service not all that great and the food wasn t all that to like make up for it  Then we asked for a manager  we were told there wasn t one    We asked who the owner was  she said she didn t know his name since she was knew    Speechless  Save your time and   and don t go there ',\n 'Over priced and over rated  just like VooDoo   If you re trendy and have more dollars than sense  this is your kind of place ',\n 'This hotel was dirty  the pool had zero chlorine  the pools had a lot of hair  the rooms are dated  the sending

yelper and I went to Hyde Park for a early afternoon margarita   We re grad students and it s the end of the semester  It s a necessary thing   Anyway  the first glaring if not unforgivable slip up was when the waiter reversed our mango and lime margaritas  even after insisting that he was giving them to us the right way around   It took us the entire time we were their to figure this out  We both just thought ours tasted funny  Grad school has rotted our brains    The unforgivable part of the experience came next  A couple of young college students were seated next to us  They ordered fries and were brought waters  My friend was in the middle of venting about a particularly frustrating experience but I was suddenly somewhat distracted by the way the couple next to us was acting about their waters     Is that a shrimp   I heard them ask   The waiter came by  apologized briefly and took the waters away  We talked to our mortified fellow diners and found out there was a cockroach in one of their waters  A big one at that   We could see the shadow of it from our table   But it wasn t only the presence of the cockroach or the fact that the waiter somehow didn t notice it  Ultimately  I was horrified and repulsed by the way the waiter handled the situation  There were no massive apologies or offers to comp the meal  No manager swooped in and said he d make it right   Instead  the waiter went back and got the couple new waters  Directly from the ice bin this time  he said  He apologized briefly again and that was it    The couple  thoroughly mortified  left  We quickly finished our margaritas and went on to Julio s down the street for our second   ',\n 'TERRIBLE service  Cranky bartenders  Mediocre food  at best  So many better sushi options in Quincy  I wouldn t waste your money or time  Fried apps were super oily and bland and sushi was not fresh ',\n 'Very underwhelming  I ordered the quinoa bowl with tofu and had a hard time swallowing it down  Worst vegetarian food I ve had in a very long time   if ever    The  marinated tofu  was not marinated  it clearly was firm tofu chopped up and maybe microwaved  super gross  the beets had to have been grated days ago because they were super dry and unpalatable and the sauce that was dumped all over everything in the weird mix of food tasted like some generic dressing from a bottle  This quinoa bowl would scare anyone away from being vegetarian if it was the first vegetarian dish that they ever had    Additionally  the dish was a pretty small portion for    dollars worth of stale vegetables and plain chopped up tofu cubes  yuck    The weird textures and unpleasant flavours make me wonder about the other dishes on the menu   In Vancouver you generally expect way more than that monstrosity  Obviously I won t be going back here ever  The best thing  the only good thing  about my experience at this café was the server on staff who was very nice and professional  This review definitely doesn t reflect the lady that helped me ',\n 'Is this business  still in business  I ve called and left a message twice and they don t call back ',\n 'Breakfast cook was coughing into his hand   rubbing his nose  then handling customer s food   WTF    We couldn t get out of here fast enough    too bad we had already ordered by the time we noticed   Our waitress was pleasant and attentive  so we didn t want to cause a scene  but we felt like chumps for actually paying for this meal which we were far too disgusted to eat   Needless to say we won t be going back  Ever    Other reviews rave over this place  they must have low standards or they were oblivious to the nasty things going on here   Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat ',\n 'Run by a bunch of bigots  Go to pollo tropical     Or hell go to KFC  Anybody that sells white meat will have better food to digest than what this joint serves up with their discriminatory marinade ',\n 'This probably the worst car rental place to get a car  I booked my car through Expedia and got this car company be careful they have a policy that states that there are no early returns  So if you book for   days and you only say stay for   days they will still charge for the full   days  Also make sure to hold on to your card before I agreed to anything the lady charged my card before I had agreed to anything when I said I didn t want the car she said it was to late and that they would still charge me the full amount  So I was stuck with a car I didn t want and there was no manger on site to sort the matter out  Whatever you do do not use this company they also go by NU car rentals',\n 'Awful lunch special  I ordered the Orange chicken and the sauce was a scary  artificial color and the chicken was so heavily breaded that I couldn t taste the chicken plus the fried rice tasted like the oil was bad or super old  Even my    year old father who thrives on  bad  Chinese food said it tasted bad  LOL ',\n 'Decent food  horrible service   I picked up some takeout from Aloha Grill tonight  Among all of my family s dinner was a few orders of  Chicken Katsu   a breaded and fried chicken cutlet with tonkatsu sauce  Upon getting home  I was astonished to find that our chicken katsu orders were merely chicken  no sauce had been included    Frustrated  I drove back to the restaurant to get the rest of my dinner  After waiting awkwardly for a number of minutes  I asked for the containers of sauce to accompany the rest of our dinner  Instead of receiving an apology for the omission of the katsu sauce  it was explained that  some customers don t like it   so it wasn t included  even as a side   How a Hawaiian restaurant comes to the conclusion that Chicken Katsu is best served sans katsu is beyond me  Needless to say  I won t be back ',\n 'The one star is not for their food  I ordered a laffa shawarma and it s solid  The one star is for their horribly rude service    I was picking up my boyfriend from KSM last night  Mar      walked in close to     p not expecting any of the food stalls to be opened  The lights were still on at Yalla  three behind the counter  with two prepping food for a customer and one woman  standing behind the cashier  There was no sign of closing down wrapping up adding up receipts  etc  I asked if they were still open and she said yes  When ordering  I asked her if the shawarma has lamb as it s not specified on the menu  she was curt and said chicken  I told her i want hummus in the wrap and she rudely told me I needed to move down the line and to tell that to the second server when there s no one waiting behind me  The second server  woman  gave me a blank look and proceeded to ask me whether I want each of the ingredients in front of her one by one  now I get why the service is so painfully slow per other reviewers   There s no list of those items on the menu or anywhere visible to the customer when ordering  that I can see   It was my first time at Yalla so I wasn t familiar with what they have  KSM is an open space so when it s not packed  there s echo  The girl was very soft spoken so i had to ask her to repeat and speak louder when she asked me those questions  She got more annoyed and rude to a point that I just want to walk away  I actually wasn t the last customer  they took orders from two other after me   Point of the story is  I understand that it s end of the day and you were supposed to close at     p  that was why I asked if you guys were still open  The second you said yes  you had committed to deliver  If you were going to be rude and act annoyed  i m actually making a generous assumption here that the two women were rude because it s end of day and it s not because of their personalities   then don t say yes  apologize and said you were closing  I would have come back next time I am at KSM  BUT  with this experience I will NEVER buy from Yalla again ',\n 'It s Walmart   What do you think happens here   It starts out looking like a decent store and then deteriorates into trash   This is how it worked in my hometown   Then there s the fact they won t pay their employees well or offer decent benefits   Or punish them for voting the  wrong way    Why would anyone spend their money here ',\n 'I was really looking forward to dine at this pub  but was greeted by a cold waitress who passed my guest an I three times without sitting us  It seems like all the staff there was rude and didn t place importance in good service to the clients ',\n 'Terrible   The Oreo Cheesecake LOOKED amazing and it was my fiancées dessert of choice unfortunately   The cheesecake tasted so much like lemon it was absolutely pitiful   I went back and asked the girl at the counter if our     piece of cheesecake was supposed to be lemon and she said that it was supposed to taste as such   I promptly let her know they should let folks know their cheesecake is lemon flavored before they waste over    on it and toss it in the trash   Worst cheesecake I ve ever had   Horrible customer service   DO NOT TRY THEIR CHEESECAKE ',\n 'We ve gone to this location a number of times  and our experience has been similar to that of other reviewers  we keep going back because of the usual quality of the Bojangle s product and because this location is right around the corner  But the service  as others have noted  is consistently disappointing    Last Sunday was a new low  We ordered chicken and sides at the drive thru window  We were told they were out of chicken  and it would be a    min wait while they fried some more  A fried chicken place out of fried chicken  Really  How does this happen  The woman at the drive thru window got snippy when I expressed the view that    minutes wasn t very fast for  fast food    We fry chicken every    minutes   we were told  So  when someone sees that you re running low on your primary product  rather than getting ready to replenish the stock  you wait until the clock says it s time    I can tolerate a degree of rudeness  I can tolerate some level of incompetence  But the combination of rudeness and incompetence not even the promise of quality product  when available  can make up for ',\n 'Saturday before noon counters were clean and only one flavor donut left  The maple bacon  Grabbed from the tray under the counter  Nothing special and over priced  A swarm of people walked in after me and walked right back out or bought coffee  Disappointment',\n 'Worst service ever    She has u waiting for    hours   have you thinking you re next  then waits til the  LAST minute to tell you   oh somebody in front of you    YOU COULDNT FUCKING TELL ME THAT SHIT WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR GOT DAMN   hours      DONT GO HERE   ',\n 'My friend and I  just left a horrifying meal at this restaurant  When they cleared our plates there was maggot that was on the table that must have been on the bottom of the plate  The manager laughed when we told him about it and said it maybe came on the lettuce for the burger   When I asked for contact information for the owner the manager told me to leave the restaurant and not to return  I recommend avoiding this unclean restaurant at all costs  I am  notifying the board of health for the area ',\n 'We ordered after seeing it on grub hub and the food was very disappointing and made with low quality meats similar to low grade pre packaged deli style  They got here quickly though  so that s one good thing ',\n 'I am really mad at this place   I printed out the coupon for     their new Friday lunch and got there around      pm   The hostess told me the wait was going to be   hours    Okay  what time do you close   I asked her   She replied that they close at  pm    Wait a second   You re telling me that I have to wait for   hours to get a chance to be seated and then you re going to close the restaurant before the   hours is over    She didn t really have a response to that except to repeat that it was a   hour wait   SO ridiculous   We went across the street to Fuddruckers where we were munching on burgers and fries within    minutes ',\n 'Worst service ever  After having an order messed up they would not fix it  After reordering and repaying it took    minutes for   blizzard  The red head manager was so rude    other employees apologized to me for her behavior behind her back  Do not go to this dq  After reading other reviews they have had many bad experiences I wish I could give   stars ',\n 'We went there for dinner  Food took very long and waitress was a bit impolite  The service is slow  The couscous and tagine were a bit different from other good Moroccan restaurants  I love Moroccan food but I will never go back to this place ',\n 'THEY DONT HAVE YUM YUM SAUCE  That s reason enough to not go  Food doesn t taste very good and they messed up our order  NEVER going back ',\n 'If I could put zero stars I would  Not only was our waiter rude  our bread was cold and tasted uncooked  we had to ask for refills on our drinks  my dinner was wrong and had no taste but worst of all THERE WAS A MOUSE UNDER OUR TABLE AND WENT RUNNING WHEN WE GOT UP  We told the manager and his response was  oh I m so sorry   Never again will I dine at a Joes ',\n 'I ve been here in the past and love the place s unique fusion  So it saddens me that I waited on a Sunday afternoon at      with staff running around looking busy but not actually taking my order  I tried to be patient but after    minutes I got up and left  I don t even remember when I last got up and left a restaurant ',\n 'Worst service ever      Payed my bill and now my service is cut off and nobody can help me till Monday  What kind of security company is that  Seriously thinking of saying screw it and disconnecting  Will not resign contract and will not recommend to anyone ',\n 'So the bar staff was cool and the band played some great songs  Problem is  the overanxious bouncer crew messed up our entire evening  They were unnecessarily rude and obnoxious  and we will never go back there  Avoid ',\n 'So very disappointed in the food recently and went June        with my daughter and grandchild and had the worst dining experience of the year  This used to be so good but it was horrible salty no sauce rubbery cheese and very little of it  Macaroni and cheese tasted like glue and if no cheese taste  My suggestion is that the owners should visit the Village Kitchen in Cambridge to see how this simple small place makes their crust and taste their different pizzas to see what they do  LOIS FROM BELMONT',\n 'Very disappointed in the food at vagabond  We live in the neighborhood and stopped in for Sunday brunch  The menu sounded appealing  but did not deliver on taste  portion size  or overall appeal  The thought of the food actually makes me a little nauseated  The bacon was severely undercooked  honestly it was hardly recognizable as bacon  It was a big pile of curled up  soggy  fatty meat  The coffee was the worst coffee I ve ever had  I m not a picky coffee drinker  but I was only able to choke down one sip  My cousin ordered the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms  He took one bite and left the rest because it was such an unappealing pile of snotty looking eggs  He is a    something year old guy who will eat literally anything  so the rest of us at the table had to take a bite to see what was so terrible about it  The truffle flavor was over the top and the texture of the scrambled eggs was gross  One positive note was that our server was very kind ',\n 'Bathrooms were disgusting  Order was wrong  Food was burnt  Over charged for the Monday special ',\n 'I placed an order via delivery com  then waited   and waited  After an hour and a half  I tried calling  no answer  and a full voice mail box  I ve been trying to get through now for more than   hours  and still no food or even anyone picking up the phone    Ridiculous ',\n 'Sooo disappointed    After all the glowing reviews about the good and the service  we were really excited to eat there   We went in between   and      and there were no other diners there   The server took our order and then she and the cook just hung around the front counter   he on his phone most of the time   There seemed to be no action going on in the kitchen at all   We ordered the dolmades for an appetizer and they were very good but tiny and overpriced at   for         Then we waited and waited   still no action in the kitchen   The server never checked on us   Finally  the meal appeared  we are still the only diners In the place    My daughters chicken kabob was so dry that she had to ask for some yogurt to dip it in and my little meat patties were so hard that I could hardly cut them   Right before we were served we heard a timer go off  so considering the lack of action in the kitchen and the condition of the meat and chicken  I think they must have just reheated the entree   The rest of the plate consisted of plain white rice and some garden salad greens with a basic vinaigrette dressing   The server never came back after we were served   When She brought the checkmentioned to her how dry the chicken was  she said   oh  really    This was around        with tip and we left extremely unsatisfied   Not worth the calories or the money   It s hard to believe that we were in the same place with all the rave reviews about the food and service     Thank you for your reply   Evidently our experience was not the average because the reason we visited Troy was because of the good reviews   That s why we were so surprised and disappointed by the unappetizing food and poor service   I accept your explanation that the meat and chicken were cooked to order but  still  the chicken was extremely dry and the little meat patties were hard and tough  There were no other diners in the place except us  so the service should have been excellent   Sorry  but that s just the way it was ',\n 'Given this place   chances and each time it gets worse  Service is horrendous because they are always understaffed during busy times  food is mediocre or will make you sick  and unless you are standing at the bar good luck getting a beer in less than    minutes',\n 'Horrible scam  To be clear  you will be ripped off here  Peter the owner of several locations in the Portland metro area is a con artist and tells the people who work for him how to trick people into handing over their credit cards and then he keeps charging your account after contract has ended  Slimy dude  Stay away  you ve been warned ',\n 'Was not seated for    minutes when we had reservations   Food is underwhelming and overpriced   The female manager was not helpful and downright rude   Clearly not up to the standard of prato and luma   Don t waste your money here folks ',\n 'The food was good but Worst service I ever had    When I say bad I mean bad      I had to get our menus  silverware and remind them we ordered drinks   We were there for like two hours  The waitress kept apologizing it s just a crazy night  There were only maybe three tables  We would watch the waitress just stand there   It was so bad I almost wanted to ask her if she liked her job    She looks just miserable  she was very rude and very lazy    When I finally just ask somebody else for a side of ranch that person just looked at me like they didn t know English    I finally just said you know what never mind paid for everything and just left   There s a big difference between being busy and being pure lazy ',\n 'Terrible food  I am Korean and this place does not serve authentic Korean food  I had spicy dakdoritang and the chicken was too gamey  what kind of meat do they use    so I only had potatoes  I never write reviews but had to leave one because it was so gross ',\n 'Everytime I make a move and don t check Yelp first I regret it   This time was no different   I chose this spot from Grub Hub delivery   My delivery options are quite limited in the new neighborhood so I couldn t believe my luck as I read the menu for this place   I thought I must be dreaming as I read all of the delicious sounding items  and I triple checked to make sure they delivered   Reasonably priced  and they were open  Great     I place my order     hours later  no food   I call  and a young lady says that it s coming up now  Wth    After I protest  she offers me a lemonade  Blank stare  Go figure   Finally  about    minutes later  food arrives   Here s the kicker  the food was actually GOOD   The breakfast potatoes I got were downright DELICIOUSLY spicy and tasty  with the bell peppers and onions perfectly grilled   I had ordered a turkey and cheese with EXTRA mayo  lettuce  tomato  and ONION  CUT in HALF  They sent a sandwich with NO mayo and not cut   I am very picky  hence the reason I take the time to very carefully specify how I would like my food prepared   When it is nothing like I ordered  it signifies to me that I am not important enough for you to even care about TRYING to prepare my meal the way I asked  and paid  you to do it  FAIL   Turns out  the sandwich was very good  the bread was perfectly soft  but the lack of care in preparation means I ll NEVER have another one   Plus  had I not had Hellman s in the fridge  we would have had a REAL problem  as I don t do sandwiches with no mayo  Period   The owner called me when Grub Hub called her  and explained that she is a  full service  restaurant  and she does the delivery orders  when she can fit them in   Had this been my establishment  I would have comped this entire meal for goodwill  and offered to try and get it right on a different day  thus ensuring a second visit from a first time patron new neighbor potential regular  I eat out   of   days a week  most unfortunately    Oh well   Not my business   I will offer this   if you don t have the capacity to do delivery service  then you should not try to do delivery service   Good luck to you ',\n 'Horrible   Came in for dry cleaning  got back shrunken pants and lost items of clothing   I didn t pay attention to the price   Dry cleaning isn t supposed to cause any shrinkage if performed correctly  I know  I used to work at a dry cleaners in college    Obviously they washed  not dry cleaned  my pants hence why they went from loose fitting pants to un wearable   I went back to find out what happened to my pants that they didn t return with my clothes and they were completely unwilling to ATTEMPT to help find them in any way   Never will I EVER go back to this business     Avoid ',\n 'TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL  Rebecca Decharme left me a message  then i called to leave a message and never heard back  So why bother to call me in the first place  Management must allow these

were told it would take  I called and was told the order was in the kitchen and it would be another    minutes  After another    minutes I called again and was told it was still in the kitchen  After pressing whomever answered the call  I came to learn that they hadn t even started the order  There s a huge difference between expecting to get the food in an hour and waiting two hours before they even start making it  Never again using grub hub  and I m trying a new Indian place tonight so maybe never again at Punjab ',\n 'Horrible experience  First off  no parking avail  had to park   blocks away in another lot  The keys were deactivated twice and would have to go get new ones  Had a friend who was staying at a neighboring hotel and came back with us during  non visiting  hours  At check out we got charged for another guest and were informed that  there is video surveillance monitoring      Really    It ended up costing      plus the cost of having to pay to park at an off site lot  for a one star hotel ',\n 'Note this phone number shows up for other removal companies       At least under a different name and addresses   Sam s   who say they move single items between Squamish and

far  That s right I m reviewing as I wait  Can t eat my dinner without a beverage  Fries gone quite some time ago  Won t be back  Place is a joke and so was our server  Stay clear people  Didn t get to eat my dinner  It s cold now  Wondering if they will top this horrid experience off by making me pay for food I couldn t eat and drinks I didn t get      waiter is here and yep  He has our bill for us  Insult to injury  Such rubbish ',\n 'Rating take out  We ordered a chocolate cheese cake and a chocolate cannoli  We received the cannoli and a chocolate cake  didn t feel the need to check that the order was correct since it was two items  The chocolate cake was dry and hard  and tasted like it was not made fresh  The cannoli shell was delicious  but the ricotta was sour  menu did not describe it as such  and ruined the cannoli ',\n 'PDX used cars omg what a shady business shame on the owner a friend of mine buy a car with this people they signed a paper saying they will make sure

you love you family shame on this untreated people ',\n 'Blue star donuts is very hyped up in the Portland food community  but personally I hate it  When I went there to get donuts for my family I was greeted by impolite staff who didn t seem like they actually wanted to be there  The donuts were very small for the price that I paid  Plus they were not very good  I do not recommend blue star donuts to anyone ',\n 'How does this place even stay in business   We live close by and went in because we promised the kids we d check it out  It is a disgusting store  and the candies look like they have been sitting there for ever  And the truth may not be too far from it   I go past the store several times a day and never see anyone going in or out   It has been about   years since we visited  and my kids have never asked to go back ',\n 'I d like to preface this review by saying that my fiance and I used to come to the Beantown Diner all the time   Almost once every weekend for awhile   We loved it here   The Beantown Diner lost a lot of respect in our book the last time we went   We stepped in and waited for a seat  the entire restaurant was full  there were no open tables    At least three waitresses told us  take a seat wherever you d like    There were no seats   When the third waitress told us to take a seat yet again  my fiance simply said  I don t see any that are open  to which we both got a  ugh  whatever  pissed off look before waitress number three stormed off   That was enough for us   No place should treat their customers like that   Great food  but after being treated like a piece of trash I don t know if we ll be returning anytime soon ',\n 'I don t know who these sales tactics work on but I guess they wouldn t be employed if they didn t  We narrowed our choice on a specific car  We got an offer from a different dealership but decided to go to HC  since they were closer  and to offer them to sell the same car to us for a comparable price    We call them and ask them if they have this car on the lot  They say  yes  several of them  We go there  The guy we talk to  Keith   has the sleaziest demeanor  His entire desk is full of pictures of his family  and by full I mean like     and awards saying  master of excellence   I m sure he has a Ph D  in Awesomeness  too  but he doesn t have physical space to display that   He tells us we want a good car  which everybody wants   but the trouble is  wait for it   no dealer in New England has it  He is able to check that  No  really  Since we had an offer we told him we would check that other place first    unless he wants to give us an offer  He says that other dealer is lying to us that he has a car and that he needs to go and check if they will be able to get that very rare car for us and THEN we ll talk price   Let s pause for a minute  Suppose you re a Honda dealer and you honestly don t have a relatively popular car  Wouldn t you start your day by calling whomever and find out when the next arrivals will be  I mean  you do expect customers inquiring  don t you  Of course  you would  Either he didn t have a car or he knew he didn t want to sell it to us at the price that we

like we owe them for the big trouble that they went through on our behalf  Like I said    I guess it s working on some people  Why else would they try it on us  As we were walking to the door the receptionist tipped the salesman that we were leaving and he ran after us but we didn t stop  He called me like   times and I didn t answer   We went to that other place the same day and bought the

treatment   However  if you re a Walk in Customer  then it s also very evident that Celine gives you very short shrift   That s right  even though her electric door chime automatically signals your entry  she still takes a few minutes to come and wait on you even when you re her only Customer   The reason for this tardiness is that she busies herself fulfilling her Catering Customers  orders first   And then  just when you think your order will soon be at hand  she adds insult to injury by taking several minutes more than necessary to finally hand you your order  Please understand that I m talking about a very simple    item order which would have normally taken only a couple of minutes to prepare   Indeed  what should have been a quick in out experience ends up lasting       minutes  And  when you re the only customer in her store  you re acutely aware that you just don t rate   To make matters worse  when you ask Celine to put a little extra mayonnaise on your sandwich  she instead hands you a small To Go container of mayonnaise so that you have to inconveniently add it yourself  I don t know whether to call these transgressions poor business practices  or just plain rudeness   Lest you think I m being too harsh on Celine  this same sad event has happened to me twice only weeks apart   Below is a list of my individual star ratings by category  The mathematical average if all categories were evenly weighted is        However  I strongly feel that Celine s rude Customer Disservice is so beyond the pale that only   star is what she so richly deserves   A  FOOD

this rude girl Ariel answered  she seemed like I was bothering her  She put me on hold then after   min waiting  I got hung up on    I called back   times and no one answered  It made zero sense  I waited   min then called back just to see if someone would answer  Ariel answered again  I was like  you hung up on me   She said it was the phone      Then asked if I  wanted to order something or     But couldn t hear me because an employee around her was loud  So after correcting my address like   or   times  I finally got my order in and she said okay it ll be this much then said and       min then hung up    I have a coupon  She didn t even give me a chance to let her know    I would try and fight it but at this point I just don t even want to deal with all that   And they wonder why

visits have shown a sharp falling off of quality in ways that even my youngest child notices  and we re at the point of looking for another sushi restaurant   This has caused a great disturbance in the force   Hard to imagine we ll find another place as reasonably priced and high quality as this one used to be   Our visit last night is a good illustration of how things have gone very badly wrong with the restaurant in general   We arrived at a time when a dozen seats at the sushi bar were open  and one table was also vacant   However  dirty dishes and food littered all the spaces  so no seating was available   We sat on the waiting bench for    minutes     watching the help talk to each other and move around the restaurant without attending to the customers who tried to get their attention   Finally  one of the waitresses brought a tub and cleaned off the dishes  and another dragged a grey and filthy looking rag across the counter     When we sat down  my kids noticed that our shoes were on food that other guests had dropped  and a lot of it   The bits of rice were especially sticky  so it was hard to overlook  and once we glanced down  our appetites diminished   It appeared that food had been accumulating all day  as it was a dirty mess underneath the table   The supplies at the table itself were all out  aside from ginger and wasabi  The soy sauce was empty  no sauce dishes  and none at any adjacent places  either   To her credit  one waitress responded quickly to our request and brought the needed implements     That was the one bright spot  though   Our orders to the sushi chefs came very slowly  and we had to ask where they were before they showed up   The waitresses seemed to feel we were intruding on their day  at least judging by their manner  and the whole place appeared dirty and shabby  not what you want in a restaurant that serves raw fish   When we paid  the waitress at the register didn t say a word  no smile or thank you  no word at all  and I felt bad about having left a tip   We feel that servers should be treated generously  but our experience last night made me think these young staff members should be fired   On the whole  this was really not a good experience  and in keeping with each of our recent visits   I don t know if ownership has changed  or someone just stopped caring  but the place seems run by kids who don t know or care about cleanliness and customer service   So sad to see our favorite restaurant come to this end ',\n 'I asked for a balayage and I got a full foil highlights  I have  short aline bob hair and the women who did my hair started off with a balayage but perhaps she didn t realize how short my hair was and gave me highlights  I have never written a bad review before  but this was a horrible experience because first it was not what I asked for and second  when I was checking out  the women who rang me up said  I know it s not a balayage but it s almost like one and less expensive   Ended up paying      because I didn t fight it because I didn t want them touching my hair again  First and last time ',\n 'Todd Jefferies is a dumbfuck   Conservative rhetoric regurgitated from the asshole

definitively a place that I will not be returning to ',\n 'Me and my boyfriend have been wanting to try this place so we went last night  The second we walked in we were greeted by an annoyed glare  I immediately wanted to leave as the girl working wasnt even slightly trying to hide her annoyance with us  My boyfriend on the other hand  was over the top nice to her  seeing that she probably had a bad day  He basically apologized for our presence  and she still couldn t muster up a fake pleasant attitude   As we had never been  we wanted to try some flavors  but she was so visibly annoyed  that we both just picked flavors to buy and left  Which was a bummer when we were looking forward to trying some of the fun flavors  My boyfriend then tipped her a wad of dollar bills and still nothing  Also  while we were taking a moment to decide what to buy  two other people came in and stood behind us  The girl leaned to look past us  and said  Do you guys know what you want   Still very visibly annoyed   Overall  I m disappointed and pretty upset  We could go to ANY other ice cream shop  but we chose to drive across town to try this one  just to get treated like crap   My boyfriend and I both work in the service industry so we are very understanding in situations like these  but this was absolutely unacceptable  We will not be returning ',\n 'I m from Connecticut    the Chili s at this location is definitely not up to Connecticut standards    The food was atrocious the service was nonexistent the table sticky and I still left a     tip avoid this place at all cost ',\n 'Was excited to take my family here while we were visiting from WA in June for my sons  th bday and it was the worst customer service ever  I was really excited to try Blue Star donuts in Portland bc it got such great yelp reviews  Pretty much the only nice thing that happened was when we walked in the hipster guy with the beard said a convincing welcoming  Hi there   And then after I asked if there were any other donut options  bc there were only    What kind of donut shop only has   options     available  Which I think was a valid question  right  I wasn t being rude at all  Just shocked at the very less than impressive display  And the fact that they are open until midnight I would think they would be making more  Well  apparently they got butt hurt that I would even ask a question  Excuse me for thinking they would happily explain how things are done to new customers  We ordered and ate our overly priced    per donut while the rude unfriendly Hipster douches gave me cold stares  It was seriously like a skit from the show Portlandia  So  if you want expensive and not very friendly Hipster service then go here  Thanks for ruining the first part of my sons  th bday with your elitist hipster attitude ',\n 'What a train wreck  I almost got run over by a driver who was driving on the sidewalk as they were rushing to get to the valet  Sucky food ',\n 'Terrible  I ordered a pretzel

Horrible service   We arrived there and had no direction   Some lady asked if she could assist So we did not knowing was takeout only    When we asked about sitting the waitress said NO  Emphatically   This is for sit down customers only  We explained no one was there to guide us and she still didn t care   We were the first ones in lime mind you   The manager finally listened but at this point we demanded our     back do to the rudeness of this tall waitress   We got our     back plus a gift card but I doubt we will go back  I am also writing the owner   Basically we were talked down to in public ',\n 'This place was horrible  In addition to taking information   weeks prior to my visit  no one verified the insurance information  Then after my visit was complete and insurance information

we were told to wait out side with Everyone else which is not a solution i do not write this for me but any disabled person they have done wrongly they said thet were short staffed that does not mean tho seats were not empty and it was gonna be our turn any way not matter how ggod the coffee was so i wonder did this person have a stroke and not know better or were the true colors of his Biz finally coming to light if any one know the true owner i am willing not to escalate until i hear from them however if i am not contacted one way other the other i will have no option but to seek

have you done to this place  It s the first time in my life I ate less than half of what I ordered  including the refried beans  How can you mess up refried beans  Just ask Los Loros  The burrito was covered in a red sauce that looked like something not from Mexico but from Mars  it was spicy in a burned horseradish kind of way  Awful  Tried to eat the enchilada but all I could stomach were the chips and salsa  Oh  and the water  Won t be back  Sad    I just wanted some standard Mexican fare  nothing fancy  It was way sub standard  How does that even happen ',\n 'This was a really disappointing experience  After reading all the great reviews I thought I would give this place a shot  first of all  this place is like being in a small basement crammed with people with almost no space to walk around  I don t understand how people find this romantic i couldn t even have a conversation with my fiance it was that loud  The waiter sat us in a corner table that was so dark we couldn t even see what we were eating  actually the entire place is dark like a dungeon The food was bland   for     you get a salad that contains a few leaves of spinach with some beets cut and filled with cheese  The chicken was dry and pasta was like chewing plastic  but for the     fixed price we had to scarf it down  The dessert was decent though I enjoyed it and that s the only reason I m giving this place one star ',\n 'Cashier did not rung up all my purchase but charged me an arbitrary      Register showed    and change     Happened quickly    I didn t call him on it which I

just left store after going all the way through it without one person asking if I needed help  Of course there was an attractive lady who followed after me who received service right away  This is a

tray and it sat on the tray waiting for my other food for another    minutes  So my sandwich was cold  Then my fries were way way way over cooked  When I finally got my food the manager proceeded to SCREAM have a nice day at me because I didn t acknowledge her the first time she said it I just nodded  On top of all that the manger had   buttons undone on her shirt in the middle and she didn t have gloves on and she put her hands all over my fries  NOT SANITARY AT ALL ',\n 'Waited almost    minutes to print out   pieces of paper  I told the Store manager that the person at the print and copy needed help and that there was   people in line and he said that is normal  That is unacceptable and if a customer is brining  a concern to a store manager he should help out or provide assistance if possible   I just left  Won t give these people my business anymore ',\n 'Coffee is always burned and order is often wrong  Walk down to the Porter DD instead ',\n 'Was visiting from out

here with a small group    rooms  over a weekend   Granted  we paid employee discount rate because one of our group works for Holiday Inn   I am reviewing this based on what the going standard rate was for that weekend  Hell  who am I kidding   Even at the discount rate it was an awful experience   We were supposed to all be together  and while we were mostly on the same floor  but not all of us   we were scattered about on that floor   But that s fine  I understand   even though the request was made and confirmed months in advance   Part of this was because they thought everyone in the party had arrived  even after admitting that they had JUST been told two of couples were half an hour away  they had given our rooms to someone else   When I checked in I was enthusiastically told I was  upgraded  from a double room to a King room  which is what I had booked anyway   and it was one of the newly renovated rooms   How exciting  right   Except it was right on the atrium  which is heavily under construction   I get it  hotels need to remodel on occasion  but they just did not handle this well   We were told what hours work was scheduled and that the evenings night mornings were quiet time   HA   Construction started over an hour early each day and went well into the evenings   Being woken up at     AM on a Saturday by loud yelling and heavy equipment was not fun   It was even less fun on Sunday   The TV has annoying settings to force you to see ads and such   took multiple clicks to actually watch the damn thing   The WiFi was really bad   I was able to surf the net  and pictures on Facebook and the like took only a tad bit to load  but could not even attempt to stream from my home server or use a VPN for work   Parking was inconvenient at best   a lot of the parking lot is taken up by construction equipment and such   Their lot is very strangely laid out   This made getting to the hotel or onto the two highways extremely difficult and annoying   You look at the location and think it s great  because it s at a major intersection  but it is a pain in the ass to get on the highways ',\n 'Service was good food was incredibly bland and over priced  I wouldn t recommend this place ',\n 'We waited for almost one hour and everyone came later than us has finished eating  So we eventually did not get food at all and we were in a rush  It is really disappointing

Standard Insurance building office eats there ',\n 'I have basically   options when it comes to getting marginally reasonably priced lunch delivered to me when I m at work  Jimmy John s is one of those options and at almost     before the tip for a sandwich and a cookie  I use the phrase  reasonably priced  very loosely  This location definitely has consistency down pat  They consistently never include a single napkin in my delivery bag  consistently forget to put avocado on my sandwich when I pay extra for it  consistently either drown my sandwich in dressing when it calls for  regular  or only put it on half of the sandwich when I ask for  EZ   thinking that maybe I ll get a regular amount if I ask for less   and consistently give me a soggy  loosely wrapped bundle of lettuce and lunch meat when I order an Unwich  Jimmy John s in general is NEVER my first choice  I d rather pay the same price  if not less  and get a sub from Publix that uses meats and cheeses that are worth the ridiculous markup  Sadly  Publix does not deliver  so I am stuck with this Jimmy John s ',\n 'I don t know why we can t give them zero stars  The lady at the desk is very very rude  She

most of the staff were very nice  Stayed here on a whim because the description looked so promising  So many pools  so much to do  so many activities  This is a time share resort where they want very much to sell you ownership  and these places and their high pressure sales techniques always leave me uncomfortable    The place is so huge that it ought to have its own zip code  The streets are narrow  so there appears to be even more cars and bodies around  Check in time is at  pm  Then you get taken to the overly friendly time share salesperson  who invites you to breakfast and won t take

told us all equipment had to be back by     pm  We had   minutes if we cared to use them  Of course  checkout time is   am  Which us fine if you want to get to the parks  but means you have to get up at the crack of dawn to use the other facilities  The golf stand didn t open till    Ok  one  resort fee  not put to good use  At least the pool we swam in was well heated    The room was disgusting  including countless hairs belonging to past visitors  owners  perhaps    on the sheets  blankets and tub  The towels were threadbare and had rust stains that looked like streaks from somebody s butt

Every prescription he did for me was wrong  and every prescription was wrong because he did not test properly in the first place    He rushed through the exam    failed to ask about dilation   failed to use a reading card etc   and shuttled  me in and out of the exam room at   min increments   he was also  examining  several other patients during the same    min stint     On top of that  he engaged in aggressive sales practices   my understanding was the doctor was supposed to have no interest or financial stake in the sales of glasses lenses   But here  in front of me  he set the price of a very      glasses I did not need    luckliy I was wary by that point and did not make the purchase   He also spent more time explaining different payment options than he d spent  actually  examining my eyes    The  prescription he gave me was a disaster   it made me naseous and dizzy    I had to go back and have the part time doctor make things right   which she did  But none of these problems should have happened in the first place     And there  was a run around about whether I would be  allowed  to get a refund for  the pair of glasses I did get there    based on the faulty prescription the doctor there had provided      They were also unable to locate one of my prescriptions  because it was never written up  Looks like the  doctor had  literally  phoned it in    I had to get very pushy to get basic good business  practice  and simple fairness  out of this shop    I never dreamed getting an eye exam would lead to a situation so tense and adversarial  but there you are    You go to these places in good faith   expecting a competent eye exam by a competent practioner    In my experience  the main doctor here operates in bad faith    and is backed by a sales team

room to fit   tables together   There was   tables around us that were empty when we sat down  There was room to put   tables together  but instead he thought it was smarter to put   tables together for    of us and another  tables together for only   people  Right there money lost for the restaurant  cause they could of sat another   people on that unnecessary table   We got there at   am

but feel bad for him for who he has to work with    The manager came and  apologized   comped part of our meal  But it was not good enough  I still believe he didn t want to help to sit us together

at an ihop  I regret my decision of not going to kerbey lane instead    Plus the kitchen must of set a plastic container on and the entire restaurant was filled with the burn plastic smell  One of my family members had to go outside  NO ONE apologized for that  people on other tables were asking what happened kimberly is the greatest no one said sorry   If you are waiting for a table right now or are planing on going here and you get there and there is a long wait  It is because the front of the house is not functioning right  It takes a long time to get your drinks after u sit down  and will

very very sweet  Me and my sister had the migas steak Benedict  It was good  just felt short on hollandaise  dish was a lil dry  My husband had the goat cheese omelet with caramelized onions and artichoke  it was my favorite dish  My mother in law got the traditional Benedict  she enjoyed them My dad ordered the crab Benedict  The eggs were shaped like a poached egg but it was more like egg whites with spinach and bacon that were put on a mold  He was expecting a poached with a layer of spinach and bacon but he said it was still good  As of the other part of my party  Couldn t tell what they had ordered ',\n 'My one experience here was scary    total used car salesmen   Since I was a first time buyer  they offered to cut the price in half   The catch was I had to buy right then    no

I politely asked if I can have it iced  The rude  barista tells me that it costs    and he won t make it again    Yes I know it costs    because I already paid for it asshole  Then he paid a big deal when I asked him to give me a cup with ice after he refuses to make me another drink  Such a simple request in my part didn t deserve such attitude  Please learn about good customer service especially when one is paying so much for a watered down drink at best  I will rather go to any Starbucks in the area   there are two  than ever go to this place again as there is friendly staff and cheaper

seated and waited for quite a long time to put our order in  which would be fine  the company was good and we were visiting   The problem occurred after we had been sitting for   hour and    minutes and still had no food in front of us   Luckily we did not have small children with us     It was   hour and    minutes from the time we sat down until our food arrived   In that time we had to ask for water and coffee every time  our server came by voluntarily one time and when I asked for some bread for our son we were brought biscuits that were  on the house   I understand that it was a special occasion  but the restaurant was only half full and of those tables I would guess that most had reservations  so they knew what they were getting in to for the day   When our food finally did arrive half of it came  a full   minutes after the first half   The one order of steak and egg was both cold and missing the egg   We sent it back  after   minutes it returned not re fired but simply re heated with an egg thrown on top  so that the steak was then over cooked   I am so sad to have to remove bluehour from our list of favorites  or in fact choices  I m afraid the other restaurants in the chain will likely fall off the list as well ',\n 'At a friends house watching the NFL playoffs and he asks Round Table or Belagios  I say Round Table    big mistake  They not only took forever to

catch the driver to see if he has any in his car  BUT     NOBODY WILL ANSWER THE DAMN PHONE  It s now   pm at night on a Saturday and they still haven t answered the phone  So now myself and my friend

from eating here  How serious am I  I made an account just to write this review  so       I went to Chedds last night on a whim because it sounded like a novel concept  grilled cheese  How can you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich  Imagine all the cheeses they can squish between bread  Delightful   We walked in and it was apparent that this was not the type of place I needed to be  There were all these crayon scribbled pictures of cheese from kids lining the counter  so automatically I m like  oh  this is one of THOSE places  Aesthetic judgment aside  I went for a BCT    bacon  tomato  spinach  mayo and smoked cheddar on wheat  Simple enough  I asked for a cup to get some of their unsweetened iced tea from the fountain  This is where the real trouble begins    As I was getting my tea  I noticed the strange  vague smell of bad eggs  I thought this was due to the fountain station s proximity to the trash can  I was incorrect  I sat down and took a sip of my iced tea and it tasted sort of foul  I couldn t quite place the actual flavor  but something was clearly not okay about this tea  I opened the lid to smell it  because of course I did   and it smelled like rotten eggs  sort of like sulfur  How does this even happen to iced tea  I had my companion smell the tea  and he agreed that it smelled awful    I went to the counter to point out this atrocity to the greasy haired slacker employee  I told him he should smell my drink  He said   No  I m good  I ll check on it  though   He gave me a new cup  I hesitantly got myself a Dr  Pepper  In all fairness  he did change out the iced tea immediately  but a smell of that caliber makes me think maybe some heavy duty irrigation of the iced tea machine is in order  Look  I d be pretty disaffected if I worked at a grilled cheese shop  too  but this was unacceptable   The sandwiches themselves are not actual grilled cheese sandwiches  They re more like panini sandwiches  made in a big flat press  They re greasy  the bread doesn t adhere to the cheese  and they re mediocre in flavor at best  You could make a better sandwich at home for much less ',\n 'This past Saturday       I called around noon to check if a pre owned A  was on the lot since I was going to be driving all the way from Tampa to ensure I didn t waste my time  I talked to a woman who said the vehicle was still available and that she would even call me if the vehicle sold in the meantime    I ended up arriving around  pm or so only to sit down and find out the car sold the previous night   Thank you for making me waste   hours of my Saturday and gas money to get over there  To top it all off  apparently there was a big bolt or screw in the parking space where I parked  As soon as I left the lot and started heading down the road I heard a clicking noise  pulled over and sure enough a big bolt screw in my tire  Thanks for nothing ',\n 'THEY HAVE MICE  I was having a great dinner with friends  celebrating my friends birthday party   A mouse was standing at our table while we were eating   When we startled it   it ran across the dining room table   My friend s birthday party was ruined and others left  I feel like I shouldn t have to pay for this  The manager did nothing to accommodate me  When I came into this establishment  I did not expect a rodent fest in the kitchen   I am outraged  Do not eat at Joe s bar

I came here for years because I love the work two of their employees did  However  my last experience wasn t as great the women who did my nails left gel all over my fingers Andy toes looked like I did them at home  I also told her that the color on my toes didn t math my fingers and she insisted it did  Once I got outside and seen it didn t and the mess left on my skin  I immediately went back and spoke to the owner  He became rude and told me he would fix two finger nails  at minimum five were a mess   He also said he didn t care about my toes  I made an appointment to come back the next morning  When I got there the first woman had an attitude and told me my toes were not her problem  Then she got up and told me she would not do anything  Then the women who initially messed up sat down to do my nails    Unacceptable  I had to argue with the owner to get my toes and fingers done correctly  I was not mad at the initially employee  I just didn t want her to mess up again and I would ve continued to go if I was handled appropriately  Although the two former women that did my nails kept me coming back  I refuse to give them anymore of my money      biweekly  due to their customer service  They had no concern for a customer who went to them faithfully and referred friends family to them ',\n 'Met my expectations for a dealership  extremely overpriced  Charged me

unacceptable  Is it not possible to keep a single decent neighborhood store in this town    I d like to announce my one person boycott of all Sprouts stores  If I m going to go to some soulless

my granddaughter   I asked if that was enough to get a real  special  arrangement  I was so embarrassed when I saw it and it looked like a     arrangement   To make matters worse it was dwarfed by a

need the kind of service provided by a  CO OP  car outlet and  after doing my homework on the   players in Vancouver  decided MODO fit my needs best   An email with a couple of basic questions netted a vague  curt response   days later  Not impressed   A phone call about the same basics and to enquire about the paperwork needed from ICBC resulted in the same snarky response from a woman who couldn t answer some of the questions and was vague on others  Lot s of  um  ah  and  I guess  replies  Not impressed  Perhaps I just got a temp in both instances but really  I didn t feel very welcome   I

this place out of good recommendations to watch the Colombia vs  Peru game and I have never been more disappointed  I paid a   dollar cover to watch the game and was completely disappointed to walk in and see them streaming the game on various websites and Facebook  The streams have fallen and the quality is horrible  They could have easily prepared and actually payed for a quality stream  for example the dedicated Bein Sports   stream that was showing the game  rather than trying to cut corners with free but bad internet streams  The management was not prepared at all for this event and there were not enough seats as well  I had to sit on the floor  If I could give   stars  I would  I would not recommend coming to an establishment that would cut corners in spite of obvious profits  which hurts its own clientele  and that would so sloppily prepare for such a big event that could further its name and business  From a bar manager that would love to fix the situation at this

waiting nearly five minutes at the bar  I paid for   Heineken s at    a piece  before walking around to find a seat  But there wasn t any  Packed with well over    people  seating was only enough to hold about    and was primarily for hookah users  The booths which lined the wall costs       which to be honest is about      too much  I left after only spending    minutes inside   For a club the

the hard work it requires to run a business and be in the service industry  but the experience we had at Trattoria di Monica was truly inexcusable  They made us feel unwelcome and discriminated

our dinner at      pm   where we were told it would be    min before we could be seated  So we ambled around the neighborhood and returned at       proceeded to wait in front of the restaurant and at      went in again to ask about our table  We were brusquely told by the hostess it would be another   min at least  So we walked down the block and returned again at      and went in to check on our table again  This time the waitress simply said she had given our table to another party because we had missed our reservation  They had JUST been seated  She was rude and unapologetic  blaming us for not being at the entrance when the table was ready  When asked if they tried calling our number given we had checked in with her  x  she simply made us feel like we did not understand how things

on my way to Natick due to improper instillation of the oil filter  Yesterday   I got my oil changed yesterday and now oil has leaked out and along side the motor  My seven year old daughter and I were stranded in Natick   We have been customers of this location for nearly seven years   SEVEN YEARS  THREE CARS  We were there when Gordon was the manger and now Fitz  For the most part  we ve been happy   loyal faithful customers   But today  oh  today when I promised to take my daughter on a special outing in Natick  the car wouldn t accelerate and the engine began knocking right as we pulled into the parking lot of the Natick mall  I had to take my car to a Sears auto repair shop to confirm that yes  my motor does not have any oil  and yes  the knocking and lack of acceleration was due to the lack of oil  and oh yes there is serious damage to my engine   Damage that WAS NOT there prior to taking my car into the Monro  Our car has only       miles on it  damage of this magnitude is ridiculous   Absolutely ridiculous   As a loyal customer I expect  my car to be repaired in a timely manner  completely and without additional cost to us   I will say this  that after several phone calls this evening to the shop close to the end business  Rick  the manager on duty  finally got a hold of Fitz on his cell phone and Fitz authorized payment of a tow truck from Natick to Watertown to get our car back the the shop  This good faith gesture communicates culpability and interest in making us whole  Therefore  I have faith that they will make this right   Monro was are  go to  place

ordered a hot and sour soup  egg drop soup  chicken with eggplant in supposedly spicy garlic sauce  and beef with broccoli  We ordered at  pm and were told they d deliver by     pm  Three phone calls

were just okay  the eggplant chicken was not spicy but sweet   it actually tasted good anyway  so that was fine  but it was not as described  The worst part was the hot and sour soup though  it was

and we tried them all several times and one by one got the bikes out   After a   hor ride we delivered the bikes back at the same station  locked them all and double checked and discovered that   of the bikes showed duration and costs on the display and one bike had a dead display  At around     pm I received an email saying I didn t deliver my bike back yet  I called the indicated helpline and spent an expensive phonecall  using a Dutch cellphone  to try to explain to a kind lady where the bike was and what had happened   Finally she decided that a technician was going to check whether the bike was at the station and would reset the bikes computer  I am now waiting for that confirmation  If the bike is not there it will cost me         But what can you do when the display stops

dessert  strawberry shortcake  was a very tiny piece more like the end of a pound cake  was hard and did not taste good at all  I tried my co workers chocolate fudge cake which was also yucky and hard  tasted like old cake  My co worker had the cheese burger and she was very unhappy with her meal  She said it didn t have any flavor so she ask for BBQ sauce it made it taste a little better  To top

delivery  So they made up that they couldn t deliver  outside a   mile radius lie and then when we called them out on us being only   miles away they told us the manager just decided to refuse us service and didn t want to deliver to us  Id highly suggest never ordering from this store because they seem to have enough business to where they can choose who they want to deliver to and treat

was given bulbs that were not exactly like the one I had but they said it was the one even though the contacts were shorter The first ones did not fit and the second ones blew out immediately when I replaced them  I asked for a refund and it was not honored because  they couldn t resell the bulbs    I was out       Very sad that that Batteries Plus Bulbs would not take responsibility for incorrectly servicing me  I went to a real lighting store and they provided me with the correct bulbs that work   This is my first negative review ever on a store  I will not be back to it and I do

to have a wide variety of foods from the simple rice and noodle dishes to the more elaborate like braise lamb hot pot   The ambience seem nice with the tasteful decor  with good comfortable seating that is not too crowded     But that s where the good side ends   Our server seemed very rushed to take our order after we sat down  at   am just when they opened    She came to our table   times in a short span of   minutes   We did not realize why until we placed our order for a couple of appetizer dishes  Hand shredded chicken and   flavor deep fried squid  and a couple of entree dishes  Fried noodles with chicken  Mapo tofu rice  Sauteed shrimp    It took almost    minutes until our first dish showed up which seem an eternity when one is hungry for brunch     When the food dishes showed up at last  we were very disappointed at every dish   The hand shredded chicken was more of cut up pieces of chicken with little taste and too many pieces of skin thrown in   The   flavour deep fried squid tasted bland    I tasted salty which is just one flavour as I tried to find more flavour   The fried noodles looked good but lacked anything special  including taste     The sauteed shrimps were not well de veined so tasted bitter   We all thought what could possibly go wrong with mapo tofu rice   Well  the mapo sauce was definitely from a jar so that was pretty hard to mess up  but the rice was too hard  tasted like rice left in a refrigerator overnight    Very disappointed at the food at Lucky Plus     To add to the poor service and bad quality food  we were presented with the same dishes we had already eaten   times over   If the food quality was better we might have taken up their offer   But we were honestly not interested in more of the same bad dishes     We hope that Lucky Plus is just testing their kitchen process to make improvements and honing their waiting service to provide a more enjoyable experience for their customers   But they will need to do this quickly as many traditional Chinese clients like myself would not likely go back after the one bad experience ',\n 'Place looked smelled great   I m certain the food is delicious    Unfortunately  despite the

addition to the fact that this whole place is filthy    This is my own fault  I ate here awhile ago and found what looked like pubes in my pasta  but were more likely beard or moustache hairs  I told

advised that the fish of the day  haddock  was only available in a fish taco  which I had no desire to eat  and told her so  At which point the waitress leaned into my face and said   you want my day    with a very surly attitude  at which point I looked at her and said in just as surly a manner    I dont like chipotle   At this point  another member of our group said she d try it  and I asked for something else and a black cherry soda  She came back after    mins and said they were out of black cherry  at which point I asked for a coke  getting just a bit exasperated by now  and off she went

it as just her having a sensitive stomach  However after a few minutes I realized I should take some precautions as I did not want to risk it  At that point I had only drank less than half of what was in my cup  Fifteen minutes or so passes by when I felt my stomach churning and at that moment I realized it wasn t just my old lady s sensitive stomach that was the problem  it was this cup of laxativ  I mean bubble tea  Thank goodness I stopped drinking it before WWIII happened in my bathroom  Not to mention  my Mom who rarely treats herself to take out drinks ended up suffering due to your

over even though the woman who walked in in front of me was literally getting the exact promotion I was asking about  WTH     They told me she  preordered  but that s a bit hard to believe bc I heard her ask for the promotion when she walked in  Appalling        I very rarely write bad reviews but this place is HORRIBLE     They do not care about their customers   I asked why no one offered me

and    and were impressed with the pictures on their website  Below is the experience     a  Switch and Bate  The room we got was much older and dated than the one in the pictures  And the check in process was   mins      b  We found ants in the kitchen and bathroom  they sent pest control  we get back and the ants were still there  The room was directly from the    s  the worst decorated room I have ever paid      per night      c  They moved us to a different room the exchange process took   hours  At one point we were waiting on the street for   mins for the bellman who was getting new keys  He came back informing us that     kids were stuck in their room because another guest locked an common door  maybe take the lock off      d  When checking out they miscalculated our discount and we had another   mins wait till the manager finally resolved the issue    Honestly for     per night  you can do much better  I am going to call their corporate offices on Tuesday           let s see what they say  The four five stars are fake or paid stooges ',\n 'After my car died requiring me to leave it stranded in a parking lot over night  I managed to get it started and brought it here simply because it was the easiest place to get to    I came in and requested an oil change and to have my starter tested  as I was     sure that was the issue  After being told that it more than likely wasn t  and my battery was likely the problem  not likely  it s a year old   They go back to do the oil change and test  An hour and a half later  they forgot to run the test on the starter  but surprise  The battery is fine  I m given a list of other things wrong with my car but told the starter is just  chaotic   After authorizing the repair on the cracked radiator hose  I wait for another hour for that to be repaired only for them to come out and tell me that my car won t start yet again and the starter needs to be replaced    This entire ordeal felt like a bait and switch  I m not mad about having to have repairs done on the car  seeing as my car is   years old and hasn t needed much work other than to replace the ignition and the locking mechanism in the drivers door  Repairs are expected and I knew this would happen at some point  I m mad because I told the employees that it was my starter  I was told I was wrong  the test was conveniently forgotten  and what should have taken maybe two hours at the most  which is what my normal mechanic at home said  it took more than      I will never bring my car back into this place for even so much as an oil change

because it took me so long to place the flavor   The burger itself was overdone and just a mess   My friends all tell me I have to go back because it must have been an off day  but I m in no rush ',\n 'My husband and I have been pleased with hooters wings and had pretty decent service at the last hooters we went to  This one I must say was pretty bad  We had a craving for some crab legs and knew that Hooters had a very good price on them  This one is close to our new apartment so we drove down there and it was pretty crowded as the NBA all star game had started    Our server brought us out our drinks fairly quickly for the amount of people there at the time  Too bad we found out after she brought the drinks out that they were out of crab legs  I was pretty disappointed but I do understand that it happens  especially in a restaurant that does not specialize in seafood   After we ordered our meal  it came out tasting great and and while it took a bit of time to cook  I could understand  People were clearing out by this time so there were a lot of tables to clean up  We finished our meal within    minutes and never heard from our server again   After waiting for the check for about    minutes  I figured she might have thought we were still eating   I m not sure  So I took both of our empty trays and put them on the end of the table  We were seated in a high traffic area so I figured that next time she walked by she would see we were finished and ask us if we wanted to order anything else or just get the check  This never happened    After another    minutes  I began to get up and stand next to my bar stool because my butt was going numb and my husband was just kinda looking around  The waitress was cleaning the table next to ours who had cleared about probably about    minutes earlier and by this time it was us and only a few other customers in the restaurant so I assumed she would get to our plates next  This never happened   Within the NEXT    minutes she cleaned up the table next to ours  then started very casually wiping down a table directly diagonal from us  there was a guy sitting there with a drink at a table that was pulled together with this one to support a large party and she began getting flirty with him  Bending over real far to wipe the table  sitting on the stool and playing with her hair while talking to him  and making small talk while my husband and I are sitting here    feet away looking at her do this with empty drinks and dishes on the table for    minutes now  After this fiasco I had enough and went up to the front counter where another waitress asked me if I needed something and I told her i had been waiting for almost an hour just for my check and then walked out of the restaurant while my husband waited at the table to pay   She ended up getting a dollar from us for the tip and an assurance we will never be back  I can understand at hooters the girls work there and try to get large tips out of single guys  I have no problem with this if they men and boys want to be suckers and throw their money at them  What i DO have a problem with is ignoring your other paying customers for ages and making us wait there all night while you are sitting at the table with a customer and acting like you are off the clock  Not acceptable  I ve never given any server under     for service even if it was pretty bad until now  If I do decide to go back to Hooters it will not be for a very long time ',\n 'This used to be a nice hookah lounge  However  I recently went and it was super GHETTO  The service was

is an employee of the farm   I just got this message from  Ali A   the morning after posting my first review    Greg my  EXPLETIVE DELETED    I assume your name either Greg easterly Are you for real or you just work the maE next door   You paid     dollars and spent a couple ours with people catering to your unappreciative personality and you managed to critique even the parking attendant and everyone else who worked at  this farm maybe you belong at the next door miserable place with the miserable  EXPLETIVE DELETED heads   No insult intended just telling you what I think of your  EXPLETIVE DELETED  up review of a family farm   edit again  Ooh  and another one  just minutes later  from  Mario K   calling me  retarded    These guys just don t know when to stop digging     A mature and well reasoned response  surely   Please read my detailed  specific review below   Note that I am in no way affiliated with any competing business  I live an hour away and was visiting friends for the weekend          I was very disappointed in the haunted corn maze  I know the farm can t control the weather  but regardless  they were still charging full price for a maze where     of the corn was laid down by the wind   It wasn t so much a maze as an open field of mud and darkness  covered in     inches of water and knee high corn stalks   It was very slippery and generally miserable  it didn t seem like any effort had been made to mitigate the mud  no hay or barkdust or anything visible under the water    Definitely not suitable for children or the elderly       The ticket lady told me that their real haunted maze had been flooded earlier in the day  so they were doing the scary stuff in their standard maze   If that was the better condition of the two mazes  then the other one must have been a literal swimming pool   Every staff member I interacted with seemed overworked and snotty  with the exception of the people doing the scaring IN the maze   they were all great and making the best of a bad situation    One parking attendant directed me to a handicapped parking area  not marked as such  and then yelled at me when I parked there   A different attendant raised her voice and took a very sarcastic tone with my girlfriend for failing to stay on the  pedestrian path  through the parking lot  it was dark and poorly marked  there was no need for her tone    The girl speaking over the PA system to make announcements sounded like the most bored  sarcastic teenager stereotype imaginable   There was no attempt to create a festive or fun atmosphere    I also have to wonder at their decision to blast modern pop music over the PA system in the main area  because it carries over into the haunted maze and really ruins what little atmosphere remained   Since I assume that the corn won t magically stand itself back up after the wind storm  and I doubt that they ll be replacing their entire staff between now and Halloween  I would definitely skip this maze for the rest of the year   I have heard that there are other locations on the same road  and I would definitely try one of those first  because they can t be any worse than Bella Organic Farm ',\n 'It s a organic meat eater vegetarian vegan   McDonald s  Using some good ingredients and mixing it with ok ingredients and than turning it into some bland concoction

change was finished instead of telling me about a confirmation email or saying thank you and good bye at least he immediately hung up the phone on me  I work in Health Care where customer service is important and he is one of the worst people I have ever spoke to  If I were the manager I would immediately fire him  This was not based on one incident  It was over     phone calls  I usually never

this restaurant via groupon  We went there and told that we have groupon and we are here for the dinner  The manager looked sad after we mentioned about groupon  And then everything went downhill  We have never been treated so horribly in any restaurants in the whole United States  We were treated as  if we are eating for free  The manager was horrible  He gave us the worst of attitude  I will never step a foot inside this place again in my life  And I suggest all the yelp user to do the same ',\n 'Just gross   Grease running off the bacon onto the plate   Hash browns was cooked with so

and allowed people coming in after us to be seated before us  Waiter and waitresses will pretty much ignore your tables unless you are in a booth  The food took about an hour to make even though we got lettuce wraps  it s chicken on top of lettuce    Not that hard    This is not the first time that I have encountered horrible service here  The first time I went to this restaurant we had to leave because we waited a half hour with no waiter or waitress even coming over to get a drink order  Not to mention that it was an odd time during the day when there was no more than    people there    I don t know who manages they need to hire more attentive wait staff that isn t just standing around diddling their thumbs  It was obnoxious the pace they were moving and most of them were oblivious to their surroundings ',\n 'I tried the hamburger  I m not sure it was even real beef    It tasted more like a sour and beef combo  The service was horrible and the prices are outrageous ',\n 'When you have your online ordering system say that the order will be ready in an hour and you call the customer and tell them an hour later that it will not be ready for an additional hour then yell at the customer and tell them that you are doing them a favor and after     hours the order never shows up and then when you call again you tell the customer that you had told them you would pick it up   you will never get my business again TRUST ME on that one  and I will let everyone know not to order from your establishment ',\n 'Wow  I m surprised at how many people have such a lack of knowledge on what tastes good and what a good burrito is  Let me start by saying this is the second time I ve been here  I really wanted to like this place coming from California  I love burritos and this place happens to be right in front of where I live  I didn t want to write a negative review after my first experience  which was horrible   so I decided to give it a second shot  First time I was here  I had the chicken burrito  It was so bland  If you re going to put rice and beans in all your burritos  make sure they re well seasoned  Their onions are just very huge sloppy chunks  I felt like I was just biting into onions  For my second visit  I decided to go with their popular pork and Chile burrito  chicken quesadilla  nachos with the meat chili and guacamole  Burrito was once again super bland  Half of it didn t even have any meat in it  I thought they accidentally made the vegetarian one  Once I got to the meat  it was once again flavorless    the nachos came out with no meat chili which I had to pay    something extra for  good thing I checked my box before I left   The quesadilla was super soggy and dripping with liquid  The guac was under seasoned and didn t even have cilantro in it  Just overall another horrible experience  Anyone who says this place is good  is not a good person to ask for food recommendations  You re better off going to Taco Bell ',\n 'I finally tried them for the first time yesterday    The food looked good  tasted good until my last bite  I ordered the escargot appetizer   Literally on the last bite  I was chewing on a strip of metal   It came from the metal scrub they used to clean the wok pan     Back track a little bit   I went after the lunch crowd  at      pm   There were three tables total with customers  including myself   I waited for a long time for the older gentle to take my order   I got my food at      pm   After I hailed down the older gentleman  he said the cook is human and he makes mistakes   When he brought out the entree  there were exactly four shrimps for a        lunch menu    I feel it was a bit pricey   I was gun shy to take another bite of my food   I only ate the shrimps after careful inspection of each one   The older gentleman did comp my food as long as I promise to give them a second chance   So I lied and said yes  knowing full well I will never step foot in that place again ',\n 'I echo the prior poor reviews and wish had checked Yelp before my colleague booked Avi White  owner and sole locksmith  I believe  at Austin s Premier Lock   Key     This unscrupulous operation charged over      to rekey some locks  or     lock  about triple the normal           In addition  Avi charged both a service call and labor  normal practice is one or the other    My associate did not catch the overcharging before swiping our company card   I initially thought the ludicrously high amount was a billing mistake   Avi was slow to respond to multiple calls  took a couple weeks  and his tone was belligerent   He only became responsive when I mentioned posting a review   He promised to come back after conferring with his  boss   but that was over a week ago and no call back   Reading the other reviews  the overcharging and poor service seem to be a systemic pattern with this company ',\n 'What an awful experience  Will not be returning  I am the ideal patient that has no cavities  teeth work  or problems  My whole appointment was just one awful thing after another       Upon my arrival I m told they don t have a hygienist so someone else will be doing my exam  Why would you schedule my appointment on a day there is no hygienist when I need a cleaning      Assistant spent half an hour taking my x rays because she couldn t get the machine placement correct  Do you know how uncomfortable it is to hold that contraption in your mouth because someone else isn t getting the camera position correctly     Assistant immediately began polishing my teeth and snagged my lip in the tool  First off  why are you polishing my teeth when my teeth haven t even been cleaned yet  Also  as the person polishing my teeth  why are you not maneuvering my lip away from my teeth so you can polish the front of them without spinning my lip into your tool     The dentist  or whomever Anna Nguyen is  returned to actually clean my teeth  and used the ultrasonic  That s fine  however the assistant was not paying attention and continued to suction my throat rather than the water coming from the tool  She also would look away causing her hand to move to then suction my lip or cheek instead of liquid     Once the cleaning was complete the assistant returned to struggling to polish my teeth and then flossed  At this time she missed both of my back molars but I did not say anything because I plan to just floss them myself and get out of there      Lastly  I opted in the beginning of the appointment prior to knowing that the experience was going to be less than professional  for varnish to be put onto two teeth  The assistant proceeded to dab the varnish all over all my teeth  getting it onto my lips and piles of the product on  my teeth   My lips are still sticky   hours later     I really wanted to like this place but it seems that it s a bunch of newly graduates or maybe interns working here   The two who handled my appointment today were not even on their website as part of their  Team   Long story short  I will not be returning and I hope that no one else deals with the same   The Pro s I can say is their front desk seems very knowledgeable  in particular their insurance specialist and the business itself seems very up to date with everything being digital ',\n 'Tried scheduling an appt  online scheduling is not user friendly though Jacoall swears it

of vegetables and starch was the equivilant of   tablespoons   I called to inquire why such a small amt for   adults and Jeannie told me that was because the quality was so high     not in my opinion  I know when carrots corn and green beans are poured out of a frozen vegetable bag   The lasagna was made with canned tomato sauce and was mushy   The containers feel like you could poke your fingers right through the bottom  very flimsy   Your money would be better spent ordering take out from a restaurant to get fresh food and what you actually want instead of whatever they cook  you have no say in what comes to your door   Live and learn ',\n 'This place sucks  Service was bad     slow and long wait for a simple pizza  The place was not even busy for a Thursday night  We had to wait    mins before the waitress took our order then another    mins for pizza     when the pizza came out it looked pale and no flavor at all  Crust was doughy     price wise  Over priced and the food is not worth the price and time  A lot of wait staff just standing around smiling     not a good choice for dinner  If the place was busy  you may have to wait   hours to eat your dinner  A good idea may be to call ahead before showing up  I can only give it a one star coz service and food was really poor ',\n 'Worst breakfast I paid     bucks for   in a long time  Avoid eggs Benedict and corned beef

the waitress didn t asked us how we liked our steak so it came out bloody bloody rare  The tapas dishes were overpriced for the quality of the food  The bathroom was super dirty with no toilet papers  Nothing special here and will not be coming back ',\n 'My husband and I decided to go here one night to grab some quick pizzas  We were out all day  and busy so we were starving  We picked up our pizzas and drove home which isn t to far about    minutes away  Anyways when we got home  I took a bite out of the hand pan pizza and it was completely raw    The dough wasn t even cooked  and I almost gagged  How in the world can someone give their customer an undercooked raw pizza  It s just awful  So naturally we called to let them know about the situation and asked if they could deliver the new pizzas to us  since it was their fault for messing up in the first place  Well long story short  they said they wouldn t because they did not deliver to our address  even though it was literally    minutes down the road in the next city over  So my husband decided he would just go grab the new pizzas   Well    minutes later my husband comes home with the new pizzas and guess what     they were undercooked and RAW     At this point I was just fed up  so I called dominos back  and told them they once again sold me undercooked pizzas   so the girl on the phone puts her manager on the phone  and I explained the situation  The manager then tells me she personally made the pizza and if she kept it in the oven any longer it would have burned  I told her well then you need to be re taught how to make a pan pizza because what they should be doing to avoid it from burning the toppings or being undercooked is putting the dough in alone to cook a bit and then taking it out adding the toppings and putting it back in to cook  Clearly dominos needs to retrain these employees at this location  Anyways point to this story is my husband had to go back a third time for new pizza  While the other pizzas got cold  They didn t even want to credit us for the pizzas but they made sure we brought the other undercooked pizzas back  Like seriously they make me laugh    What are they going to do resell the pizza that should be trashed  What a joke  Needless to say  I contacted corporate and I hope they take this matter seriously because as a customer and for this huge inconvience they should do something  Anyways do not go to this location unless you want raw dough for your meal ',\n 'I arrived at      today and was told they were  all done  despite being open until    The barber who delivered this news shrugged when I asked why and then said they were short staffed  which would make sense if they didn t have barbers on every chair    This is one of several times I ve arrived before the shop is  closed  and been turned away or found a locked door ',\n 'I ate this place with my mom   It was a big disappointment for both of us   The 马兰头拌豆腐， the vegetable is not  马兰头，the dish seems to be taken out from refrigerator for a while   We order another dish which supposed to have crab and shrimp inside   However there is no crab at all   The waiter said that crab meat is dissolved inside the dish soup   That dish costs for      which name is totally misleading   In the end  we have to pay this low quality food for             they even could not accept visa credit card   They said only over       can be paid over credit card   In the end  I have to pay on my debit card   We travelled from San Francisco    We have ate in many nice shanghai restaurants in San Francisco     We are very disappointed by suhang  not only for its ripoff price  but also the low quality food ',\n 'Everytime I go to this location I leave annoyed  Why is there a cash register in PINK    Because whenever I walk up to it and start to wait in line the cashier is so always so rude and says go over to the other side  Mind you all she was doing was chatting it up with a customer she knew  There is only like two girls in there that were actually helpful  They need to really get it together in there  They re so unprofessional   seriously  They need to hire people that actually work instead of chatting ',\n 'It closed       What a shock   It s kind of hard to make money when the servers don t wait on customers ',\n 'Had no complaints until I received a credit card charge for  smoking damage    The hotel manager  Ms  Emily Nebrasky  said that she personally inspected the room and noticed the smoke damage   Neither my husband nor I smoke  We never have  We had no guests in our room  While there I did notice a slight odor but chose not to complain about it  Despite advising Ms  Nebrasky that we are prepared to sign affidavits to this effect she refused to reverse the charge  What happened to the customer always being right ',\n 'After twenty plus years of buying food from Cathay Pacific  its come to an end  The final straw was paying     dollars for lukewarm food

living social voucher and thought that I would be able to use it for a move out clean since there would be no furniture or anything but turned out that they said they could add the voucher to a move

 yesterday   So when they arrived which was hours after they were supposed to  they were supposed to call us to let us know when they would be done  Apparently  they came around       and didn t even call back until the next day only to complain that they were not even able to finish the job because they were so overwhelmed by having to clean a prior job and felt that it was too much to clean our apartment  They complained that it was too much to clean the refridgerator  oven and bathrooms  Now when you do a move out clean  that is about all there is to do  other than cleaning the windows and such  Basically Ms  DAWN CSERNAI was rude and very unprofessional but not completing the job she and her crew were initially hired to do on Monday in which she had us waiting   hrs only to tell us that she couldn t do it on Tuesday and then to call us on Wednesday to say that the job was too difficult  Very unprofessional  unreliable and rude  Do not offer specials if you can t handle the workload and do not accept a job if you have no experience in doing it ',\n 'I m very disappointed with the menu and price change that recently took place at Panera  I ordered from the new pick two menu and my lunch was     and the piece of bread was really small as usual   I rather go to Sweet Tomatoes and for the same price I get a better variety and the food is actually fresh unlike Panera   Just in case you didn t know Panera soups come in a bag and are re heated at the restaurant and their bread come in a package and baked there   And of top of the service is not the best and the bathroom is always dirty ',\n 'Save yourself the time and support a business that practices better ethics  Good food never makes up for the sour taste that accompanies discrimination and unfair treatment  Ever  Don t discriminate your customers based on their race  what language they speak  or whether you re friends with them or not  Every customer deserves to be treated the same as any other  I would give negative stars if I could  worse than zero  I would pay not to come here again   Arrive and guy at front counter asks  what do you want   Obviously  food  Why else would I be here  I am asked  Do you want a sandwich or soup   Well I don t know  Could I sit down and see a menu  please  He sits us down and tells us they ran out of beef pho but they still have turmeric noodles  Since my guest and I have no other soup choices  we both order that dish   Table of six people walk in less than   minutes later  One person obviously has been here or knows the people  Waiter guy states they have beef pho but ran out of turmeric noodles  What  Just said the opposite to me  They then produce   bowls of beef pho    more bowls for their own workers  and even fill extra to go orders for that same table   Don t go telling me that you re out of something when you offer it to another six customers right after me  Sure  you might know them  But how does that make you appear to other customers who are in the restaurant that weren t given the option to order that dish because you claimed you were out   Cherry on top after all of this      minimum for credit cards and debit cards   Bottom line  Again  absolutely cannot support a restaurant that provides generally poor customer service like rude waiter s  or blatantly lies can t treat customers equally  I cannot accept any form of blatant discrimination  Doing business these days isn t just about what you offer or the quality ',\n 'disappointing    ran out of pearls and my pineapple slush was completely ice  five

Well  this was my last visit to any of their restaurants  and I use the word restaurant loosely  Their wings are tiny   The service is snail like   Does it really take    minutes to deep fry some sh tty chicken  This particular location was grossly understaffed on a Saturday night   Hmmmm Saturday nights with a lot of sports on TV may make our location busier then a Tuesdsay at       AM  Maybe we should staff up     Our waiter had   LARGE tables all by himself  he was actually very nice and trying his a   off  But one man can only do so much  The manager in charge was grossly unqualified to do any type of damage control    This was the last trip for me to this or any crap hole  Luckily for the denizens of south Hilliard  a Roosters is opening just a half mile up the road  I ll see you there ',\n 'Seemed fine years ago  Used them to host a nonprofit site for free  then a low price  Then they started some weird stuff  like asking for non profit evidence every year  Then they stated asking for domain renewal confirmation that created fees if we missed the notice  so I added auto renewal with my credit card  Then started charging my card before asking for non profit evidence and making it hard to get refunded  They just became a big PITA  I cancelled three weeks before renewal  but they charged my credit card anyway and did not resolve it with email or chat  There is no phone number to call  This was the first time I have disputed a credit card charge with a bank  It was very frustrating  so here it is  a bad review ',\n 'Not worth the trip  Small portion or giant plates  You decide  Bad service and low quality food  Very loud in the restaurant  I honestly can t figure out how they stay in business ',\n 'I stopped by February          and found the place didn t exist so I went to the mall customer service desk and was told they went out of business in November      ',\n 'I brought my      Chevy Malibu to North Shore Auto Body after it was in an accident and had extensive front end damage  The work took two weeks longer to complete than promised  When I finally got my car back  none of the parts used to repair the front end fit properly  see photos   Dave told me that he fully warrantied all of his work  but when I brought the car back to address this issue  I was told that it was due to the fact that after market parts were used and there was nothing he could do about it  I unhappily accepted this answer  but a few months later I noticed that the parts were so ill fitting that they were starting to shift and were lining up even worse than they did originally  I went down to speak to Dave about this in person  He was not there so I left a note for him  and was assured that I would hear from him the next day  That was over a week ago  and I have yet to hear from him ',\n 'Called prior to coming in to ask if they can treat the scratches on the sides of my      Highlander  The person on the phone said that as long as you can feel it with your nail or something along those lines  they can buff it out    I went in and asked the service person before handing my car off and he sampled a little spot and said that it ll look a lot better because they re going to use a machine to buff it out  He gives me a recipe slip and tells me to go inside to pay for it  My total for the Ultimate Exterior was      give or take since they were having a promo on detailing    I left and came back   hours later when I received a call  The car looked nice and shiny since it was in the sunlight but there were still some spots on the car   I was literally standing there picking black things off my car with my nails when a lady came up to give me my keys back  She noticed I was picking at my car and started to help me pick off the black spots   Obviously she knew that it was unacceptable that spots were left on the car after a      detailing job   I left somewhat unhappy about the job they did on my car and now  a couple weeks later  I notice white marks left on my black trim  They weren t there before I took it in and my scratches have come back    Basically  if you want to pay over a hundred dollars for a car was and some waxing then come here and get your car  detailed   Complete waste of my time and money ',\n 'The curly headed blonde boy at the concession stand was utterly rude and condescending  The absolute worst service I have ever received  For a high classy theater  this server is not trained to provide a delightful customer experience yet one that is obnoxious and undermining  He needs to go or more customers will ',\n 'This was basically the most disappointing dining experience in Austin  if not in my entire life  This restaurant came highly recommended as one I should definitely try in my neighborhood  so maybe I had too high expectations  The food was worse than low end pre frozen microwaved diner food  You might like this place if you grew up as a starving child in western Africa and this was the first place your adoptive parents took you when you arrived in the US  Otherwise  steer clear and don t believe anyone who tells you this place is great  and you  have  to try the fries  Trust me  it s not worth it  Ignore my advice and I guarantee you will experience extreme buyers remorse and mild heartburn ',\n 'As a Chinese guy  I should say taste of this restaurant s hotpot is boring  Worst than make hotpot at home  Eating at here is waste of time ',\n 'This Parking deserves a NEGATIVE ranking   Probably The Ultimate Worst Parking lot  in the East Coast    Please note that   a   It s probably one of the only parking in Boston where you pay a  Valet  charge  but you have to park your own car       b  There is no mention whatsoever of mandatory  Valet     c  They provide you with a ticket that mention that your car is damaged      just in case       d  They are so eager to grab your keys that it s a challenge to try to exit your own car     e  The  Valets  are just plain rude     Avoid at any cost   Take a cab  Take the T  Walk if needed to ',\n 'The amenities aren t amazing but they aren t terrible  Same with the units  But the staff is the worst  We had a leak  everytime it rained water came in the window  After   months of the management saying they would fix it  our lease ended and we left  I would not recommend  if you have any problems  you are on your own ',\n 'This place is not even packed and it took    min to be seated and is now taking another    min to get a server  Fried tomatoes was beyond salty  felt my blood pressure increasing with each bite  Waiter

Beer   I was planning on trying a variety of beers but my plans changed   I was watching the MLB playoffs and the game was close and in the  th inning   I was ordered a flight to try a few beers and the guy switched the tv to thursday night football   I asked him to turn it back and he said no because people wanted to watch football   I looked around and no one was watching so i asked the few people at the bar and they said they did not care   I told this to the main bar tender and he would not change it back   I canceled my beer order and left   I will not be returning if i am in the area   There are far too many great bar food locations to waste your time at this place ',\n 'I rent cars when visiting Oregon several times per year and use a variety of rental companies   Generally  I consider Avis an upper tier rental company   Since I was adding some leisure time to the tail end of this business trip  I decided to use Avis   What a disappointment   The car received was a very very worn bare boned Jeep Patriot   The interior was in bad shape  the brakes squeaked constantly and the car s ride was terrible   By far the worst rental experience in years from any company   I m sure Avis would have swapped the car if I d returned to the terminal  but with tight timing it wasn t possible   My concern is why would a car of this poor safety and quality ever be rented by a company like Avis ',\n 'I ordered a meal w  one side  and two regular order of sides   enough food for two people  Chicken express employees decided to squeeze all of this food into one yellow box   meant for one person  I m allergic to okra and there was so little room in the box that my biscuit was completely smashed by the side of okra   yum  Please choose many of the other establishments that share the block with these idiots ',\n 'I am giving this review two stars because I have always gotten good service from Checker Cab via  Taxi Magic  in the past   First  I tried calling Checker repeatedly during the late afternoon  always getting a generic message that said that no one was available to take my call   I left a message  with no call back   I then used the online booking tool that allowed me to book a cab  I received a that said I ordered a cab at      pm   I was trying to get to a concert at the Lakewood Amphitheater  which started at  pm   I received a text that my cab was NOT dispatched  and placed another  order   via Taxi Magic and was told via text that the cab was dispatched   After another    minutes  I decided to just drive   I just want to know   why are cab companies  especially affiliated with Taxi Magic  not available via phone  and why are they not jumping at a cab fare that would be around     with tip    ',\n 'So we had a reservation for   at  pm     meg our server was very friendly   we had to ask for an extra setting   the entrees took an one hour and    minutes to come   very slow   we did have apps  the wine took a while to come   the busboy wasn t very friendly   no smiles   steak dish was cold   my seafood dish was pricey for a very small portion  as the dinner went along the service level got slower   one entree was under cooked   took over    minutes for it to be re delivered    for the prices charge the level of service is lacking   portions are on the small side too   I won t go back   the manager came by to ask about the re cooked entree but didn t offer anything nor did he say thanks for coming or ask about our food   Over priced   poor service   average food no real concern for the customer  I m surprised how you stay in business    disappointing for almost      spent     ',\n 'I bought flowers from Twig for my sister s first Mother s Day  My family and I thought Twig would be the perfect place to get them from  I went on their website and picked out an arrangement and called to place the order for the ripe arrangement   First of all the girl on the phone wouldn t put pussy willows in the bouquet because she said they wouldn t look good  Funny thing is I m a florist myself and didn t appreciate her argumentative attitude about what I wanted    The arrangement came and the design work was horried  It looked nothing like the arrangement online and all the flowers were cut short like an amature had made this  I understand the vase was like a rose bowl but it looked like there was no rythm or reason to the design  Within   days half of the lilacs  surprised they even used them in the arrangemen  died  This was a centerpeice for a dinner party and my family and I are shocked of what arrived to my sister s south end home   I called Twig on Monday when the flowers were delivered on Saturday to express my disappointment and concern  I spoke to a sales girl who said she would pass my information onto a manager and someone would call me back   It is now Friday and I have not recieved a phone call nor do I expect they will call  I will never order from Twig again and feel they are extremely unprofessional and need to hire more experienced designers ',\n 'I received a total hack job  I asked for help on the sides and the stylist asked me what size do I want  I would never go back there even if I was paid to do so  My haircut looks like it was by a blind man with a weed wacker ',\n 'I ve pasted the review I posted to the Facebook page for the franchise and on the Wendy s corporate page   EDIT   FEB           It happened again   I ordered three junior hamburgers  NOT cheeseburgers  and a large fries at the drive thru   The order taker repeated my order for accuracy   I get up to the window  get my order  and discover the fries are rather overcooked   I was given replacement fries  but was made to wait until two other customers had received their fries   sandwiches   The replacement fries were on the edge of being overcooked   Then  upon arriving back home  I discovered I had received cheeseburgers   AGAIN   FOR THE  TH TIME THIS MONTH   Each time I ordered hamburgers   Each time I received cheeseburgers   How hard is it to tell the difference   I hope the franchise manager is reading this   I ve written a complaint to Wendy s corporate too   This was just going to be about the fries   Then  I got home  and saw my burgers   I ordered four junior hamburgers  ketchup mustard only on each of them   I saw my order accurately listed on the display by the drive thru menu   I get home to discover I have four cheeseburgers   For me  that s not good   I ve never cared for the cheese   Wendy s  just a personal preference   The cheeseburger thing has happened twice now   The fries   for the  th visit in a row  the fries were near inedible   I m not sure if they re always overcooked  just sitting around too long  or a combination of the two   It seems I can t get fresh fries unless I visit during the peak of lunch rush   All of that is a shame   Wendy s is my preferred fast food burger chain  and this is the location closest to my house   But if my orders keep getting screwed up  why should I come back ',\n 'I just came back from this place today  I was excited to try the food after it was recommended to me by a coworker  The Jerk Chicken was bland  as if was made to be served in a nursing home  The plantains were hard and the rice tasted like to much cinnamon was added to it  Jerk Chicken is suppose to be spicy not sweet  which is exactly what it was  Very disappointed  especially for food the cost         I honestly can say that I don t see this place being around much longer  With this quality of the food that they are serving and their high price this shouldn t last ',\n 'The food has gone downhill and cheap over the past year   I ordered there so called  jumbo wings  and they were smaller than BW    On a second occasion I ordered a steak sandwich   The bun weighed more than the amount of meat   Finally  on another occasion I ordered the nachos and they used cheese sauce  like you would get at a baseball game   The food is not inexpensive and you would not expect this quality   Do I need to say more    ',\n 'I ve been coming here for years and they have always been helpful but the workers today are especially nasty  I love the weekday crew compared to these grumblers  I spent over     here and the least they could do is be polite  Boo on the barista and boo on the lady at the register  The only friendly one was the blonde girl who seemed to be the lowest on the totem pole  No thanks for you guys ',\n 'Pretty sure I had written a review about   year ago but it mysteriously disappeared    well back then I had ordered the hot chicken teriyaki I ordered was just teriyaki with red pepper flakes dumped on top  Seriously   Well    fast forward one year later and I decided to try their burgers based on the reviews  NOPE  just NO  False advertising  They are not charred  The beef tasted like they pan fried the patty  It also tasted and looked like something that you buy pre frozen at the store  DO NOT LET THE GLOWING REVIEWS MISLEAD YOU ',\n 'Stopped by for a margarita with a few friends  Service was terrible   Went to the bar for clarification about a friends drink order and was shocked at how rude the bartender was  She was curt  short and bitchy  Not to mention the horrific smell of sewage when I entered  Good customer service may have over shadowed some of this  I was embarassed to have even suggested this place to my friends    Iwill NEVER come back  again ',\n 'I ll start off by saying that I grew up around dentists  my mom had been in the dental industry for over    years  The girls at the counter were very nice  however the dental assistant was a ghetto mess  She was unprofessional and insisted I call my mom while I was there to find out if her job  which is a dental surgery office  was hiring  The dentist then suggested I get a root canal  and my teeth are in no condition to need a surgery like that  so I told him I would not be doing that procedure that day  I have some sensitivity due to braces  he never asked if i had worn them  but nothing that would warrant a       root canal  In addition   the heigenist is religious and decided to subtly me know i want living my life right  I m single and on birth control  I don t want kids  I watch too much tv    All because I war engaging in her small talk  Oh  and the computers were filthy with dust    scares me as to the cleanliness of the tray of the facility    Bottom line  they are an unprofessional office that will rip you off if you don t know any better ',\n 'If I grabbed the right one  this is in the Austin airport  Unfortunetly I have been here twice out of desperation since there is not a lot of options at the airport besides food court type  The food is fine but the service is probably the worst I have ever encountered anywhere    If I didn t know better I would think that the servers were prisoners that are forced to work here  Zero sense of urgency or care  They are a bit understaffed but if they acted like they were trying a bit the tips would show it    The first time I ate here the waitress tried to talk me out of coming in  She said we close in an hour  I said well that s fine I hope to be on my plane by then ',\n 'Way over priced  Food quality was really bad  Noise in the place was way to loud for any kind if conversation  Took an hour to be seated  Had to send my food back and have them take it off the check  Couldnt eat it  Burnt and tasteless  In summary  too loud  too expensive  bad service  food really really aweful  Would have preferred going to Dennys ',\n 'The worst bar customer service I ve ever experience I ordered three tacos and extra kimchi the bartender did not let me knowthat there was an up charge for extra Kimchi  when I got my receipt there was a five dollar up charge for KimChi  when the manager came over he told  mr it was a fifty cent up charge so therefore I should ve only gotten charged a dollar and    Cent  The manager then proceeded to argue with me and let me know that the bartender was in the wrong but also that guest get offended when you let them know there s an up charge I disagree I want you to know if I have to pay extra for anything somethings are not expected to pay an up charge for unfortunately as good as the food was I will never return back to this restaurant simply because the general managers customer service was horrible he walked away on me at the same time agreed with the service that I ve gotten and agreed that the service that I got and was correct which was poor service',\n 'Horrible place  Hotel gave us a     off so we went there  We gave the coupon to our server right when we sat down  When the bill came at the end she told us the coupon wasn t valid for what we ordered  If you like dealing with used car salesman this is a great place to go ',\n 'Yuck  And I m being generous  We were all geeked on finding this vegan veggie Chinese restaurant  But were sorely disappointed   We were the only ones there  asked for recommendations  and opted to order take out  We focused on the  meat  dishes  The food all tasted the same    and not good at that  Kinda like they used the same sauce for everything with just very minor alterations  We ended up tossing half of it away as it was just that unappetizing    Vegetarian vegan can be made so good  and there is so much potential with Chinese and Asian cuisines    so there is just no excuse for their unimaginative  boring  bland food ',\n 'Terrible customer service  They served less than     a cup of mostly inedible beef gristle  soggy  fried  rice  and a soggy egg roll for    dollars  We thought there must be some mistake because of how little meat there was  but they refused to fix the issue when kindly addressed  The woman claimed   The chef doesn t make mistakes    The new portions are an absolute joke  hit up Sea Dragon  China House  or Din Ho for a MUCH for satisfactory meal with a bigger bang for your buck  There is a reason the dining room is usually so empty  this place will be closed soon no doubt   Check out the photo I uploaded as proof  I d like these crooks to address this issue ',\n 'Awful  Bad Service  Average overpriced sushi  Dirty  We went on a Saturday night  The waitress rushed us and pretty much tossed our food on the table as she ran by  My Husband s meal came out about    minutes before my sushi  We didn t have napkins or a silverware and had to ask several times  There were three fly s flying around our heads the entire time  I will never be going back ',\n 'i went here for my birthday  NOTE  If you sign up for their online email mailing list known as the Chef s table  they will send you a    dollar certificate for your birthday month   This means that you may use that    dollars during the month of your birthday  My birthday is in July so I went   First of all  being from LA  I didn t expect much knowing that Austin doesn t have as huge an asian culture as LA  However  from everywhere else  I expected portions to be  bigger  like the Texan way  I was sadly mistaken  It cost at least    dollars a person  Presentation was horrible  The chef barely did anything cool  The one thing he did do was the volcano which has been done hundreds of times  The quality of the food was subpar  Ill go back to LA for Benihana',\n 'Wow  it hard to imagine this to be worse  Super slow  poor service   Hard bread  not fresh   No receipt  Had to ask twice for water   But the kicker was the cookies  My husband ordered   raisin and one chic chip cookie  First we were told there were no raisin cookies  even though we could SEE them  She nodded when we pointed that out  and she sold us the two cookies  then immediately turned around and dumped the rest of the cookies on the tray into the trash  SERIOUSLY  ',\n 'Never ask for help from store manager Billy  He is a moron  We asked for help  and he avoided helping us at all costs  He immediately tossed our questions aside  and proceeded to scream for Rebecca repeatedly becoming agitated that she wasn t able to meet his immediate needs  What did he do next you ask      keep screaming for Rebecca like there s a god damn fire happening in the toddler section  Billy  you suck at your job  and I hope corporate reads my post ',\n 'There is nothing that this bar offers that you can t get practically anywhere else  I don t like to throw this word around but I honestly feel this place is racist  I ve seen them not let in my African American friends for their attire when there were other patrons

an office visit for some vision problems  and when I walked up to the desk to check in  the receptionist didn t even look at me or say  Hello   She just said   Name   Then  the optometrist that saw me had absolutely no bedside manner  His shirt was untucked  he didn t look me in the eye  and spoke in medical jargon that made no sense  He insinuated that I had a very serious eye condition  and then did nothing to explain it or soothe my worries  I ended up going to an ophthalmologist because he insinuated that I had a serious issue  I was not about to let him examine my eyes further   Turns out  my eyes are perfectly fine  I shouldn t even have glasses  and they ve been feeding me prescriptions for years  At this point  I feel like I ve never had a proper eye exam from this place  The place is empty  they have hardly any stock  and all the frames are out of date and cheap looking  I wouldn t be surprised if this place went under soon  Do yourself a favor  and never go here ',\n 'Horrible   Not sure who shit in the bartenders corn flakes   Below average food   Over priced   Arrived in a great mood  left wondering how this place was still in business ',\n 'I decided to try here because I drive by it all the time  I did takeout  I ordered crab Rangoon  drunken noodles  a Thai salad and a mango smoothie  They told me    minutes and it wound up being a little more than that  no big deal  The set up is a little different than I was expecting their register is sort of half way in the back almost behind a curtain  I paid about     for everything  The crab Rangoon wasn t what I was expecting  it seemed like there was some kind of fish with egg  I ve had crab Rangoon from Thai places before and it was still with cream cheese I m thinking maybe they misheard me or I ordered the wrong thing ok no big deal  I open the salad and there is a big black hair on my avocado  Gross  I throw the avocado out and try to see if I can stomach the rest of the salad  It seems ok but after the hair not really feeling it  Move on to the drunken noodle and they just taste off to me  Too much fish sauce or something  Can t even eat it and I wind up throwing everything down the garbage disposal  Mango smoothie I drank while driving I m not sure what o was expecting but there were all kinds of strange textures going on and after reading some of the other reviews I do not want to know what it was  I m sad because I really wanted to like this place but I am grossed out and will not be going back ',\n 'The food is mediocre  The service is terrible  They messed up everyone s order  No one refilled our waters or brought out more bread  despite asking multiple people multiple times',\n 'Okay  to the point  This place has given me the worst customer service experiences  Not only once

about      AM  I walked down to sharps to receive just a shape up      minutes tops of a barbers time   I ve sat patiently for longer than an hour  Out of all of the customers that a barber have picked up  I wasn t even greeted  The receptionist didn t even greet me  she was sitting on her phone the whole time      There were many flies flying around the seats also   I then decided that it wasn t worth the wait anymore and I left  FYI  these barbers also have given me razor bumps plenty of times and have cut into my actual head from time to time  Many of their good barbers have left and moved on to different shops as well  I ve been going to this barber shop since i was    and now I m    and I m deciding to part ways with this particular shop  If anybody needs a barbershop

  Went in around  pm on a tuesday  based upon reviews  thought place was going to be packed  not one single table with paying customers  just   employees sitting at one of the multiple tables in the back partvof the restaurant  and   other people arranging tables and walking back and forth  Finally  after   minutes  the greedy server came around to take our drink order  some of us order iced water  some coke  and sprite  and my son order a lemonade  which after   minutes  she told us they where out of   She offered him either a coke or sprite  which he rejected  and asked instead for a glass with iced water   After   minutes  SURPRISE  he had a lemonade on the table  or at least looked as one  but no it was a flavorless glass of water with lots of sugar in it  Now  going to the food  dumplings were delicious  eggroll tasted like frozen food boxed one  sweet and sour pork was crappy  crispy beef was great  walnut shrimp was ok  about a B   chowmein and fried rice were lousy  flavorless and warm  not hot as they should   When the check came  I don t understand why they impose you a        tip already included on your bill   I don t know if you agree with me  but why should you tip that much for service that was bad  and when the server doesn t do a good job according to your expectations and in turn tries to push items that increase your check  so that she can pump up her     tip that she didn t deserve   Tips are deserved with the quality of your service  terrible service   no tip  bad service   no more than      ok service   upto      great service       up to no

There is always a line of at least   people  and  despite usually having at least two people on staff all the time they will never put more than one person dealing with customers  They have an incredibly unhurried approach to service  even when the line is snaking out of the door  I don t think it s ever taken me less than    minutes to do anything here  aaaargh  I feel like like I m in a

there was a bunch of extremely salty cheese INSIDE the burrito as well  and an okay amount of steak  This was probably the SALTIEST BURRITO I HAVE EVER ATTEMPTED TO EAT IN MY LIFE  I had a stomach ache for   hours after I ate half of this burrito   I rarely give out   star reviews  but both of my friends did not like the food here either  Poor quality  and extremely salty ',\n 'Horrible customer service  Their story keeps changing every time I call about what times they can possibly come  Additionally  they won t notify you before they come   you instead are supposed to just wait around for   hours for when they might show up or leave an extra key with them   Who has that sort of time  especially at these prices  I found other services that were willing to call me half an hour ahead of time and who provided way better customer service  This company isn t worth your time ',\n 'I purchased a Groupon to tan for my wedding  when I came into Tan Republic the young girl working there gave me ZERO information about the salon  the beds and the lotions   She suggested a lotion that caused my skin to break out in small bumps and put me in worst bed for me for   minutes  I WAS BURNT ALL WEEKEND   Everything she did for me was not at all what was best for me with my Irish heritage and very fair skin   I went in on Monday and talked to a different girl who convinced me to purchase a different lotion to help my skin at a very discounted rate and gave me a free tan in the Diamond bed  She worked really hard to make things better    The next day I came in and talk to the owner  he was a complete     HOLE to me and basically told me that his employees are lazy and now that is my fault and my wallet is going to have to suffer because of their lack of effort to serve me as a customer   I have wasted over ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS from my wedding budget now on tanning and am completely screwed over    I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND GOING HERE IF AN OWNER CAN TREAT CUSTOMERS LIKE

by peeling off the chicken skin     Disappointing   Plus  the restaurant staff is not helpful and not flexible  There are many open tables in the restaurant  but the server push all their guests in one side and all tables are pretty close  i can reach my arms out and touch other table  I asked to change table so me and my friend can feel comfortable and have our conversation  because we can hear other people talking and loudly   The staff refused to let us change even tho there are so MANY open tables  I can t understand this place ',\n 'This is the closest Mickey D s to me so it is almost essential  They are pretty fast and drive through is never overwhelmed  The food has never be anything to complain about but the employees are terrible  with a exception or two   I always am pleasant

the menu prices so people are prepared  Luckily I had my card and not a     bill  So the reason for the   star is because after she told me the prices may change she hung up in my face  Rude  I usually order from E San Thai but there usually really busy at lunch   The food at Maiphai is okay but E San Thai is much tastier  its just a block up the street and the staff are much friendlier ',\n 'YOU DON T ACCEPT PAYMENTS OVER THE PHONE      This is super unbelievable    Tonight I called to make an order for my wife to pick up  I tried to pay with my card over the phone and guess what    They

frustrating ',\n 'This review is solely about the breakfast service   I used to come here every weekday morning for breakfast tacos and coffee on my way to work  A few months ago they hired a couple of new guys for that shift  and since then the service at breakfast has declined sharply    The guy who used to run the counter at breakfast was cheerful  courteous  and FAST  There were plenty of all the different types of tacos wrapped and ready to go  and I could grab my coffee  choose my tacos  pay and leave in less than five minutes  usually just as long as it took me to fix my coffee and take out my wallet   The first time I went since that guy left  there were two new guys  one running the counter and the other preparing the tacos  Both of the kinds I usually get weren t ready  and the taco prepper took a while to make the tacos  then set the bag down on the counter without letting the guy manning the register know that they were ready  I stood there for several minutes until the cashier noticed the bag sitting there  even after I told him they were ready and had been set down    The last time I went there  there was only one customer ahead of me in line  who looked tense and irate  waiting for the same  taco prepper  guy from the previous time to fix his tacos  he usually wears a bandana on his head   This time he was also running the register  I got my coffee  waited in line while the gentleman ahead of me finally got his food and paid   The guy came and took my order  started chatting me up while he sloooowly made my tacos  Then he asked me if I was okay  I guess it showed on my face that I was annoyed   and I told him I was just in a rush  Then he loudly said that they re never in a rush at Live Oak Market  and I told him that they used to be  and that I used to be able to get my order quickly  He told me to have a nice day  and I left    I ve worked in customer service for years  including working as a barista at a busy coffee shop  and I find the notion that  rushing  during what is known as  rush hour  on a weekday morning to be perfectly acceptable  The primary reason people stop there is because  yes  the tacos are good and so is the coffee  supporting local businesses is important  AND because you can jump out of your car  grab your food and coffee  and get back on the road in five minutes or less  or you should be able to  rather   If you re not prepared to  rush  between the hours of   and   a m  on a weekday  and you re serving breakfast and coffee  then you re in the wrong business   Luckily  a family owned taco truck opened directly across the street from Live Oak Market in the old Valero parking lot  Their tacos are less expensive  taste much better  the staff is friendly  and they re always ready when you get there  So  no more Live Oak for me in the mornings  I make my own coffee and get tacos across the street     During the rest of the day  the staff is great  and I still love the store in general  but I hope they replace their early morning staff  ',\n 'I have sent   packages that are serviced to this Post Office   Both tracking numbers say out for delivery and shipping is delayed   One is over a month

whoever made our food got our orders all mixed up  We figured  whatever  we re hungry    burritos don t have to be perfect to still be great  But when we bit into them they were COLD  and the service was really fast  which means their ingredients are just hanging around in the kitchen at room temperature  GROSS  My friends wanted to send them back but we figured they would just microwave them or

staycation  and had checked into the W hotel for the night  After a relaxing afternoon of massages at Bliss we made a reservation for       at Maggiano s up the block   When we arrived it was bustling with Christmas parties  Birthday celebrations  and groups groups groups   Definitely not the most romantic couples setting  but we were fine and welcomed the energy and fun company   However the service was pretty abysmal    We checked in right on time for our reservation and the host told us it would be a short wait  We asked if we should get a drink at the bar and he said no no no you ll be seated very shortly  So we shifted to the side allowing others to come and go  and we waited   and waited    and waited some more   After about    minutes we shifted about   feet to the bar which was not very crowded at all  There we waited    and waited   and waited again although the bartender was not busy at all   Finally I shouted out my order for a Stella draft and he snapped out of it  brought me my beer  and took my guys  order   We drank our beers and still  no table   Eventually after over    minutes I went up to the Host again and asked what was up   He looked perplexed and then realized he had given our table to someone else in error   You know mistakes happen but we were standing right in front of him and I tried to make eye contact half a dozen times but he never once looked away from his computer screen or from chatting with colleagues    We got a brief apology and were finally seated   Luckily we were in such a good mood we didn t let the past half hour get in our way of a good time   But here s where the real fun begins   We were sat in the middle of it all   Parties all around us but we didn t mind  though my bf had to move his seat every two minutes for waiters to get through as we were apparently sat in their immediate line of traffic   We did however mind the fact that we had to wait over    minutes to order drinks  another ten   to order our entrees  another    to receive   And what was put in front of us was the saltiest food either of us had ever tasted   I like salty food but my pasta dish was INEDIBLE   By this time it s after     the crowds have thinned out and there are teams cleaning up all around us preparing to close down   When the waiter came to clear our plates and saw I hadn t eaten my meal he did ask why and after politely telling him it was too salty  he took the pasta off the bill which we did not ask for but we did appreciate it    In the end we experienced really bad service and were fine with shrugging our shoulders and chalking it up to the busy holiday season  but the fact that our salads  app  and entrees were unimpressive and overly salty really added insult to injury   The good news   I was planning on having a heavy Italian feast  but I end consuming very little food  which is much better for my waistline    ',\n 'After a mediocre meal and poorly made drinks  they lost our credit card  Not only did the other servers not help to locate it  they thought it was funny  After the    minutes of terror  they found it at the bar  The manager came to our table and left   free dessert with purchase   coupons in our bill folder  I was not satisfied  The manager was rude  not understanding  and impatient  After talking to him for a minute he rips up our ticket in a sarcastic manner at our table and walking off in a huff  I vowed to never go back  Never ever again  If you go  pay in cash  Don t risk your credit card security ',\n 'I m with other reviewers who were underwhelmed   Portland has some viscious competition for breakfast places but even so   the good experience here ended with being seated quickly  early on a Sunday   Decor   I can get past less than chic surroundings when all else is worthy   In this case it just gave us flaws to look at while waiting  Service   bad is really all you can say   Impolite to rude   Orders were incorrect   Generally it didn t seem if anyone cared if we were happy or not  Food   over priced and underwhelming   Everything was very basic and portions were small   I prefer a portion like this to the      cal meal you are presented other places  but not when I m paying over     for a plate with no meat or seafood on it   Like another reviewer  we were also given one sliced strawberry  in October  as the fruit with the meal  We live in a beautiful city with a great food culture   No need to come here with so many other places to choose from ',\n 'Clearly a business owner with absolutely no regard for the fact that a REAL customer might not agree with him or other reviewers   I was a real customer who simply chooses not to even communicate with someone who cannot take the slightest bit of criticism   Someone from your business  along with a member of the Cousins management team  wanted to come into my company s office and discuss the possibility of us doing catering business with WL   I told our receptionist we are not interested   If that makes me a  fake reviewer customer   then that s fine with me   If I ever was going to give you a second try  that definitely won t happen now   Had you not immediately tried to flag my first review as being fake or from a competitor  I might have considered that you were having an off day the day I tried  but since you decided to make it personal by

visit  we had a reservation and were promptly seated   Our waiter was at the table just after we sat down   He took our drink order and salad order   When he returned with our drinks we placed our dinner order that consisted of three side dishes   Fettuccine Alfredo  spaghetti marinara  and spicy sausage   What seemed to be longer than expected for our order  our waiter brought the fettuccine alfredo and spaghetti marinara   He immediately left   Both of these dishes were lukewarm at best   The spicy sausage never came nor did the waiter come back by the table to check on us or offer a drink refill   After about    minutes I got  his attention and asked about the sausage  his reply was that it should be coming   After at least another    minutes he brought it and dropped it quickly on the table with no comment and left   No management was ever seen   Finally got the waiter s attention again  sent the sausage back and asked for our check   That took time also   Just the worst in service  lukewarm food  and no concern apparently by management to check on the customers   Too many choices in the Arena District for this place to expect us to return ',\n '     do not go here  Look I never review  This place though got me feeling some type of way  We went out on a Friday night so it s ok if it s busy but this place was pretty relaxed compared to other spots  But the wait to get a table was    minutes then when we we seated no one checked on us for    minutes  Other tabled seated after us even had their orders taken  We didn t even get a drink order in     outta    wouldn t do again ',\n 'The course was in terrible shape whenwe played on Saturday  it was overbookedwith no rangers out to keep play moving  Iuse to play there twice a month but not now until they repair the

happening right now    I bought a groupon for a full set of eyelash extensions with   fill  I go to my appointment for the full set of lash extensions  I m right on time for my appointment and I walk up to the glass door  which is locked  but I see the woman  who I assume is going to do my lashes because she s the only one in the small room  and she is on her cell phone  She notices me when I walk up to the glass door by looking in the mirror and seeing my reflection  She continues to talk on her phone and hasn t turned around yet to face me  I knock and she still doesn t run around  but I know she s already seen me through the mirror she s staring into  I was thinking  what s going on here    Then after about    seconds of me staring at her and her back turned toward me  she finally turns around and points to the chair sitting outside the glass door and when I look down I see that it has papers to fill out for first time customers  I sat down in the chair  mind you she s still on the phone and hasn t unlocked the glass door  and fill out the paper  probably taking about   minutes to fill out  I stand up and face the glass door and she s still on the phone  I m standing there laughing at this point because I can t believe this is going on  Then I had to pee  so I just walked away from the glass door and went to the bathroom  this place is set up inside a building with other clinics salons   I go to the bathroom  walk back to he glass door and she s now what it looks like saying goodbye on the phone and then unlocks the door to let me in and says  sorry   I was so mad  but didn t say anything and went on with the lash appointment  I ve gotten lashes done before so I knew what to expect  Basically the outcome was mediocre  I wanted monger and told her  but they were average length  and my left eye was red and hurting for   days afterwards which has never happened before with pervious lash extensions from other places  I will never go back there again and seriously that woman was so rude to be on her phone ignoring me for so long when I got there   for probably    minutes total ',\n 'This place is way overrated    Im not from the area  and my GF whos from there  gassed this place up to be something special  Went on a Friday night recently  around    Some lady who worked there helped us find a spot in their lot  which was a nice touch  as parking in SoBo is beyond attrocious  cars might as well be banned from parking within the city limits  We sat near the bar area   Hella loud in there  sounded like some obnoxious souls were in the vicinity  Yelling and hollering and such I mean i get it its a a bar but it was only around    We get seated and waited around   m to get a waitress to our table  Service overall was really slow  After we got our decent cocktails  another      m passed before we got approached to order meals    As for the food  we decided to just get entrees  My Gf got the pork chop and it seemed to crisped on the outside  almost burnt  Her risotto was decent  but overall it was lackluster  I was gunna opt for the prime rib  they were out of it at the time  No biggie I had a lobster pie in the on deck circle   So I got it  really rubbery and quite bland  The portion wasnt that great either  Not sure why I got fries with it  but I did  The fries were ok  oversalted thought  We waited another   m after we were done for the check  When the check came  my GF and I split the bill   For the food and service we got  this place is overpriced   I heard the quality took a dive after they remodeled it  from my GF whos been going there for a while  Seems like the place is surviving on name prior reputation and old time regulars  I wouldnt go back  Week later we went to the Lincoln Tavern up the road  and I was blown away that place was incredible and a better value   Final note  after I ate here and checked some other reviews the night of  I stumbled across one of the restaurants customer service reps for yelp  Don  His replies were very unprofessional  belittling of the reviewer  yet entertaining  due to the fact  I couldn t believe someone who represents the establishment would write such things  I read all the poor reviews to see him go to the point of attacking the patron and accusing them of being at fault for their poor service  never seen anything like it  In this case  on a public forum its probably better to let the poor reviews stand alone  rather than make the establishment look a bush league eatery ',\n 'The people who work here are rude  rude  RUDE      I needed razor blades  which are locked up  and the person on the floor couldn t be bothered to help me get them  and then complained when I needed more time to figure out which ones were the right ones   I will seriously never go in there again  if I can help it   There  s a Walgreen s right across the street   Go there instead  is my recommendation   They take FOREVER  but at least they aren t rude ',\n 'Scenario  new to the restaurant  We walk in and are greeted by no one  Restaurant is quite empty  We aren t sure what to do so we approach the bartender and ask if we can seat ourselves  She doesn t give us a firm yes

seated and waitress brings them water     minutes now go by  Restaurant is filling up  we know this because we are sitting in the middle of the room  front row seats   At this point we are hungry and pretty annoyed  My friend tries to flag down a waitress and she  without exaggeration  ignores her and continues on her way   Now please be aware that we are polite  patient people who wouldn t normally leave  but tonight we received the worst service imaginable at a restaurant  We ended up leaving still without silverware or water on our table  I wish Yelp could take away stars as this

going to have  If you ve been to Luke s you know that they have an open concept restaurant  Our server came over and took our order but upon looking around we saw that all the servers including our server  were seated at a long table on the floor eating what I suppose is their lunch  I use to work as a server and it has never been acceptable to eat in front of guest especially if they do not have their food yet  There were about   servers seated just eating  We got our food pretty quickly and were very excited to start eating since we love this dish so much  Unfortunately it did not taste as it normally has in the past which is AMAZING  We still ate everything but when our server came around and asked how was everything my husband asked if they had possibly changed the chicken recipe  Because it just didn t taste as it did all the other times we came  She explained that the recipe was still the same so we said ok no big deal  I saw her approach the manager on the floor to tell him about our question on the chicken recipe  He looked at me while she was talking because our server pointed to our table and he rolled his eyes like he did not want to be bothered about the situation  Plus we were the only guest at the restaurant at that time  He not once came to our table  Me and my husband were not looking for a free meal or anything free for that matter because we ate the dish  As a manager you should be concerned with all guest especially returning guest  Unfortunately we won t ever be coming here again ',\n 'I have come to conclude that all Steak and Shake restaurants are

decided to go work back up north that I wouldn t need my membership anymore   He said he would make note of it and would cancel it himself even if I didn t move   Four months in the manager left for another location without me knowing and when I tried to cancel my membership they told me I couldn t unless I actually moved my permanent residence somewhere where a Steve Nash was not located   I guess that s what I get for taking someones word and ended up paying for it for another   months    Also  the parking is HORRIBLE  I have never seen worse   Must have seen at least a half dozen accidents in that four months and if you go at a bad time your waiting    minutes or more for a spot   The place is VERY busy too  sometimes it was even hard to get on a piece of equipment   There

treated as rudely and disrespectfully as I was this morning by the manager who was on duty for brunch    My friends and I wanted to sit next to the window  which is an openable overhead door similar to a garage door but glass panes   The door was closed due to the cool winter air  The only table available was near the main restaurant door  but I was ok with putting up with that door opening and closing as patrons came and went   Our server was attentive and courteous and we placed our orders   As soon as our coffee came  another guy came by and asked   Do you mind if I open the  overhead  door    However this was not a question     it was a statement     meaning   I am opening this overhead door      I objected and asked that he not open the door due to the coldness outside   As my friends later observed  this guy actively ignored me  He proceeded to open the door entirely     I pressed on and asked him to close the door   He told me other patrons asked that it be opened   The people sitting next to our table gave me a quizzical look     I asked the guy to get the manager  at which point he said he WAS the manager   I told him  calmly  that this was bullish t   Again  he actively ignored me   At no time did I raise my voice or cause a scene   However  my friends and I picked up our belongings and went up the street to The Nook where we enjoyed our brunch and the

soak it in acetone and get impatient so they use the drill and it completely ruined my nails because they overdid it  It s taken months for my natural healthy nails to grow back  They even charged     to remove my SNS  I asked why it doubled because they charged me    the first time and they said  because we re starting again  whatever that means  It seems like they make up prices  They rush to get you out of here  Wouldn t recommend ',\n 'Three tables occupied in the entire place on a Friday morning  We were seated promptly and ordered quickly   We waited an hour for eggs benedict  There was not a rush of any sort  When they did come  the egg whites had not been at all cooked  We could not finish our meal and left shortly thereafter  Expensive  nasty and unaccountably slow  If you really must eat breakfast on Hawthorne and can t stand to wait to be seated  I guess go for it  just make sure your expectations are exceptionally low ',\n 'I ate here several times a few years ago because it was convenient  But the grime  the lackluster and possibly grimy food  and the sullen staff just turned me off  I went back again this week because my husband insisted on trying it  Our tap water came in styrofoam cups    mine was stained with dirt  The service was still sad and the space was still grimy  The falafel was fine but not made with love  and I m actually just hoping it doesn t make me ill  I don t trust that place ',\n 'Even one star is too many for this company  The company is very resistant when it comes to cancelling a reservation  I requested a cancellation within the full refund window  The guy who runs this company said the reservation has been cancelled when it was not  The refund did not come through and the dude went non responsive  I had to file a claim via PayPal  The company runs ads on Craiglist with multiple different names  I really should have paid more attention to all the negative reviews here  Please study them carefully and save yourself time  money  and energy ',\n 'This place is terrible  My mother is from the same part of India as the owner and this places food doesn t even hold a candle to the food I eat on a daily basis at home  This place is for dumb white people who think they are eating good Indian Veg food when in fact they are just being robbed ',\n 'Oh dear  What a sad state of affairs this is  To think that the organizers have been doing this for years and yet the market s constant is only its continuing state of decline is just pathetic  Firstly  do not even try to tell me that there is no indoor space they can put this junkyard carnival in  Vancouver is one of the world s foremost business hubs with convention and event spaces galore   not to mention that the VConCentre was only steps from this nightmare before christmas event  no offence to Jack Skellington   who would have been appalled at sheer nonsense this place hides within its    admission gates   Spare your cold nose  ears and extremites as well as yourself the cash and time and spend it all somewhere else  Preferably give it to the many homeless people lining the streets of the harbour rim    German themed  PLEASE  There must have been   German booths in total and the rest were manned by randoms selling shitty tchotchkes and people that were very obviously not German trying to sell me and my very German husband perogies  Pathetic  German Pizza  Doesn t that sound inviting  Oh  its just regular pizza and the people making and selling it aren t even German   surprise  surprise   The one saving grace of this place was the authentic pork hock stand  but in below freezing temperatures  it was either we lose the tips of our noses to frostbite whilst standing in the long and winding line in the rain and dew or wait till our next trip to Europe to sample a  shweinshaxe  and stein of Bier to wash away this horrendous experience from memory ',\n 'What more can I say  If I had listened to past reviewers  I would have known that the food would be late   I had   excellent experience through Foodler  however  and thought   why not    Well    hours later  I had to cancel the order   When I called Night Owl   I heard  the driver is running slow because the roads are icy   probably true    he already paid for the food   and it will come out of his pocket if you don t want it   guilt  guilt  guilt  eeek    and  but he s almost at your house     I explained   everyone has left   what am I going to do with all of this food    The response by Night Owl    Fine   It will just have to come out of the driver s pocket    Then  he hung up   I feel horrible   yes  my mother raised me with guilt as an effective tool   but why pay for food I wasn t going to eat  because they are running hours   hours late    My guests had already left   I d rather munch on peanut butter crackers than cold  guilt infested food from Night Owl   Sigh    I m never using this delivery service again   Foodler s great  but Night Owl should be ashamed of themselves ',\n ' pm Sunday   closed  thought the sign said Tavern ',\n 'Awful   Awful   Awful     We went here for lunch yesterday   i cannot put into words how awful our service was  Waiting over an hour for a bowl of soup and a crab burger   Not to mention the waitress asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks    mins before we received our meal   We received our food and finished eating   still no refills   I could not get out of this place fast enough    Never mind the fact I asked for rolls and butter when we first sat down  when I received the check the waitress still said they were in the oven  Basically she forgot  since the table next to use received their rolls   mins before    Management should really take control of this place  if you cannot handle the amount of quests that you have in the restaurant  You should be on a wait  You re not doing any justice to anyone by seating everyone that walks in the front door  If your staff cannot handle it  Leaving guest sitting at tables looking around for help    If you re Service at      that day because you are under staffed or over seating     Do I only have to pay     of my bill    of course not  So I expect to receive good service  And eating my meal with nothing to drink is honestly just that basics ',\n 'Dined on Tuesday  June     First the good  Incredible fried chicken  well done  Unfortunately can t say much for the rest  The yellowfin tuna sandwich was about     the size of the bun  definitely not worth the cost  But the bun was at least good  The travesty was the famous Hyde Park fries    stale  cold and the final bits of the pile  Ended up eating four or five and tossing the rest    these are Hyde Park fries we are talking about  Seems like no care was being given in the kitchen  Not at all up to par with the main location ',\n 'In this Argentine inn you have to make a reservation to enter  lack of ethics made us wait more than    minutes and the restaurant empty Just because they saw Latinos giving race preference to the white Anglo I do not recommend this place freeze burn Empanadas of yesterday for more than six dollars  am not  not   not  never return here    En esta fonda argentina tienes que hacer reservación para entrar  que falta de ética Nos hicieron esperar más de    minutos y el restaurant vacío solo porque nos vieron Latinos dando preferencia a los anglosajones No recomiendo esta fonda  Empanadas de ayer por más de seis dólares Yo no regreso aquí ',\n 'My family tried this place last night for the first time to go see Inside Out    I wish I would have known more about the way things worked before I went  The over all atmosphere was  ritzy  nice  and very clean  The movie was displayed nicely and the seats were very cushiony and comfortable  I didn t realize I paid for the cheaper seats that do not offer food service and that was really inconvenient  The lady at the front told me I could order at my seat but I guess she was wrong  I had four kids with me and my husband had to stay with them while I brought out food for everyone   I felt like I was interrupting other people    and I missed a lot of the movie  Our dinner  dessert  Alcohol  and tickets added up to       An employee whom I believe was a manger  saw me carrying a lot of food on my own so he offered to help  which was very nice of him but when I grabbed the tray from him half of my     pizza fell on the floor and they didn t offer to bring out a replacement  that made me upset  I spent a lot of money with them and he saw I was struggling  I just think that they should have done something about it  Another thing I really didn t like   I saw him touch his face at the food counter and then pick up some fries it his bare hands and place them in our dish  They hype up the food with the names and the price as if your getting some amazing gourmet meal  and don t get me wrong they also present it well  but it was like cafeteria grade food if you get what I mean    not good   not worth those outrages prices  This just goes to show you looks are not everything    it looks awesome and its comfortable    but so is the movie house off     and there prices are a tad cheaper and the overall experience dining and all was much better and they had really unique menu and the food was amazing and everyone gets service regardless of the seating ',\n 'I feel like they just were not trying   They seem to be proud of their bacon  so naturally I ordered the B L T   Flavorless tomatoes  white lettuce  and the bacon  oh the bacon   The dry  evenly hot  beggin  strip looking bacon   Judging from how dry and evenly hot the bacon was  my only guess is that it was microwaved    A MICROWAVE     What a sin   What a shame   Simply disappointing ',\n 'There were maybe   tables in the restaurant   yet the waitress was too busy talking to her buddies to assist us  Food was horrible   My daughters honey bbq wing sauce tasted spoiled   and the Thai curry sauce was sour  not sweet as the menu synopsis stated     Yuck ',\n 'The staff does not communicate with each other and one of the managers  Ralph  does not seem knowledgeable about his job nor does show eagerness to help customers  I was constantly being given different if not incorrect information throughout my entire rental process    I paid an alternate method  money order  when dropping off the car and somehow the money order has been  misplaced  And they still charged my card after Ralph said it wouldn t be  I have now paid over      for a standard week rental  And only after calling bank  corporate  to which I was given the wrong number to  and money order company  my request to review the video footage is finally being obliged  Overall outcome of this is still pending  WORST RENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER ',\n 'By far my most disappointing bar lounge from any of my visits to Florida  I am in Florida at least one a year so I have been to many establishments over time and have never experienced service as slow and disappointing as this place  Two out of three nights here this trip they have been out of Bud Light and every nigh the service has been the slowest I have ever experienced in any bar lounge in any state  The only other bar open past   pm was also out of Bud light and closed at    pm  After waiting    minutes for a bartender to take my order  being told that they were out of the beer I had been waiting for was not what I wanted to hear   Hope not to be back to this hotel bar again ']",
